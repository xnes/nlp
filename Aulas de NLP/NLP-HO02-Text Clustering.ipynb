If\\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \\nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\\n\\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \\nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

english joe@trysteroartcom start lot clients xsession whatever sleep second two launching one changed xclients script logging actually took less time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works warner losh imp@solbournecom provided good explanation works summarized start x server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process touches large number pages process running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps stagger launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstation's limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently xinitrc situation like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm

files inquirers method organizing personal resources following benefits easier maintain usable fewer resources stored x server resourcemanager property side benefit server may start fractionally quicker since doesnt load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also drawbacks application interested load additional file every time starts seem make much performance difference might consider huge boon usability modifying application's resource database need rerun application without xrdb xrdb default run xdefaults file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch c style comments xdefaults file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources xt provide error message encountered c style comments resource files simply silently aborted processing resource file loss preprocessing handy eg ifdef color'' enough cause people dismiss method resource management may also run clients break rules example neither emacs 18583 xvt 10 find resources anywhere xdefaults starting client machine share files machine resources stored client find resources loading resources server guarantee clients always find resources casey leedom casey@gaussllnlgov possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resources heavily used clients eg xterm xdefaults file use separate resources files method clients seldom use define display properly client programs often executed machine server situation rather setting display environment

contact support@purecom info purify inserts additional checking instructions directly object code produced existing compilers instructions check every memory read write performed program test detect several types access errors reading unitialized memory writing past malloc'd bounds writing freed memory purify inserts checking logic code program including third party vendor objectcode libraries

similar results would occur used one highquality commercial compilers market locking server ram anyone tried hacking x server locked ram get paged eg via call plock help performance i've one inquiry topic pointers plock function call hard evidence someone who's tried position give try thanks eric c claeys ecc@epermattcom danny backx db@sunbimbe juan martin juando@cnmuses starting server joe english joe@trysteroartcom start lot clients xsession whatever sleep second two launching one changed xclients script logging actually took less time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works warner losh imp@solbournecom provided good explanation works summarized start x server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process touches large number pages process running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps stagger launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstation's limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently xinitrc situation like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm i've experimented sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 2 exec xbiff sleep 3 exec xterm sleep 4 exec xterm i've even tried sleep 2 exec startxclientsscript startxclientsscript sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm idea last one make sure xinit completely finished processing xinitrc settled steady state sleep expired clients launched yielded fairly comparable results stuck current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suits fonts loading fonts takes time ram minimize number fonts applications use get speed increases loadup time one simple strategy choose small number fonts one small one large one roman whatever suits configure clients least heavily used clients use fonts client programs start quicker font already loaded server also conserve server resources since fewer fonts loaded server farrell mckay fbm@ptcburpptcbuozau joe english joe@trysteroartcom eg main xterm font 7x13 also twm set use 7x13 menus icons etc twm's default font 8x13 since normally use 8x13 i've eliminated one font server oliver jones oj@roadrunnerpictelcom keep fonts local workstation rather loading nfs make extensive use r5 scalable fonts use font server resources file keep xresources xdefaults file small saves ram saves server startup time joe english joe@trysteroartcom one suggestion xdefaults xresources file try putting minimum number resources want available applications example reversevideo true separate resources individual clientspecific resource files example homelibappdefaults login file set environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaultsn compwindowsx frequently asked questions faq contains excellent explanation environment variables work ed xterm launches loads resources appdefaultsxterm xdvi finds appdefaultsxdvi forth note clients follow xxxxx resourcefile naming pattern check system appdefaults directory often usrx11r5libx11appdefaults find proper name name personal resource files name documented xt specification pg 125 666 thanks kevin samborn samborn@mtkgccom michael urban urban@cobrajplnasagov mike long mikel@eecornelledu kevin willing mail setup files inquirers method organizing personal resources following benefits easier maintain usable fewer resources stored x server resourcemanager property side benefit server may start fractionally quicker since doesnt load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also drawbacks application interested load additional file every time starts seem make much performance difference might consider huge boon usability modifying application's resource database need rerun application without xrdb xrdb default run xdefaults file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch c style comments xdefaults file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources xt provide error message encountered c style comments resource files simply silently aborted processing resource file loss preprocessing handy eg ifdef color'' enough cause people dismiss method resource management may also run clients break rules example neither emacs 18583 xvt 10 find resources anywhere xdefaults starting client machine share files machine resources stored client find resources loading resources server guarantee clients always find resources casey leedom casey@gaussllnlgov possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resources heavily used clients eg xterm xdefaults file use separate resources files method clients seldom use define display properly client programs often executed machine server situation rather setting display environment variable hostname00 hostname name workstation set display variable unix00 00 access optimized routines know server machine use shared memory method transferring requests thanks patrick j horgan

Atnuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereasfossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hotwater.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in manyfossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactivecontamination.Wayne Martin\n",

I want to draw the lines#in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using#XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay#around when the window is refreshed.##Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:##   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */#   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */#   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;#   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;#   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;#   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);#   XFlush( myDisplay);##   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);#   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);##Then to draw I do:##   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);#   XFlush( myDisplay);##And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:##   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);###What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of#whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If#the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are#over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor#function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and#redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).##Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?#I believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground ofthe GC to be (foreground^background).Patrick L.

The noise you hear is due to the momentaryopening and closing of the path.The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In highimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristicimpedance of the circuit.

Ifyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and willnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance ofthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was foran officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Manylaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RFfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the policeare writing citations right and left for people using radardetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he hadfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it wasthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at ornear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep mefrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when myspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radardetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (whichis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend toobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind onlyworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwaveenlightment may be necessary.So, the questions are -  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector  antenna?  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?==============================================================================Randy T. Agee - ARS WB4BZX       | At some point, you probably pondered The P.O.

They work as an antenna pickingup that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there wouldbe no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be ofdetecting whether some one had a radio in their car.  Neal Howlandnhowland@matt.ksu.ksu.edu \n",

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigsNot possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator forjust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slowdown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet    away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be    caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio    transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).   Good instructions are included with the chokes.   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.And please remember to be friendly when approaching yourlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperationand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (mostare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimesdealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghostpictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether ornot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part ofbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makersto take any precautions.Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators arerequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no morethan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call startingwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even requiredto) and fire/police have other private ids.--Douglas S.

All other uses must receive prior permission in writingXfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.XXABOUT THIS FILE:XX    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries toX    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).XX    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments aboutX    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules areX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.XX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.XX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->\t\t      |XXXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:XX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.cX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.XX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI CX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilersX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal withX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessorX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.XXXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:XX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  SeeX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.XX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entriesX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one yearX    might be 'old' the next year.XX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically applyX    a number of tests to an entry:XX\t* look at the original sourceX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCIIX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' linesX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' linesX\t* run it through a C beautifierX\t* examine the algorithmX\t* lint itX\t* compile itX\t* execute itXX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has beenX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.XX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certainX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for theX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well asX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, givenX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry thatX    does something interesting when you run it.XX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leaveX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real lifeX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer requestX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of theX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.XX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us knowX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuseX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to theX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends toX    annoy more than amuse.XX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entriesX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to useX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)XX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes makeX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularlyX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen someX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.XX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims thatX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better offX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th powerX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctlyX    working entry is best.XXXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:XX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  WeX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor testsX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as farX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.XX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:XX\t#define d defineX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define fooXX\tint i;X\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declarationX\tint k;XX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If youX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result inX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.\t      |XX\tint i;X\tchar *c;X\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] insteadX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] insteadXX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number ofX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide varietyX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list areX    not portable and must not be used:XX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variableX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variableX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list argX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list argX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variablesX\t* using va_list as a structure or unionXX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.XX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.XX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While someX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.XX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entriesX    must not assume that it returns an int.XX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they doX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that peopleX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look forX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.XX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.XX    We tend to dislike programs that:XX\t* are very hardware specificX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specificX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specificX\t      code is likely not to be)X\t* dump core or have compiler warningsX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)X\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*xX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limitX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphsX\t* are longer than they need to beX\t* are similar to previous winnersX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)XX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering theX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your programX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.XX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the sizeX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order toX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feelX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better offX    if you show some amount of restraint.XX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impactX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to getX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.XX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blobX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical CX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a thirdX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interestingX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!XX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claimX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicatingX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)X    know of a smaller one!XX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries thatX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don'tX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't dependX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.XX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries andX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X clientX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and theX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyoneX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  NotX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (orX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  BetterX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.XX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items onX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required linesX    in the ---remark--- section.XX    We like programs that:XX\t* are as concise and small as they need to beX\t* do something at least quasi-interestingX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)X\t* are portableX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation styleX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATIONX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)XX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, yourX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in severalX    areas really does help.XX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments inX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had toX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.XX    Be creative!XXXENTRY FORMAT:XX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request yourX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about theX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)XX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how toX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning thatX    is found in mkentry.c:XX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  EveryX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program producesX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,X\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, theX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with theX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.XX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to checkX    the entry against the size rules.XX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints aboutX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)XX    The following is a sample entry:XX---entry---Xrule:\t1993Xfix:\tnXtitle:\tchonglabXentry:\t0Xdate:\tMon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993Xhost:\tUn*x v6, pdp11/45X\t2.9BSD, pdp11/70X---remark---X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.XX    It is likely not to win a prize.

If an entry wins, we will renameX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optionalX    digit in case of name conflicts.XX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.XX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, sourceX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in theX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpfulX    if you did one of the following:XX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.XX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:XX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binaryXX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special sourceX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.cX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_nameXX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special buildX\t\ttail +4 build > special_buildX\t\tsh < special_buildXX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version ofX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  YouX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.XX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoidX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You shouldX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  ThisX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.XX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  WeX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If theX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode themX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,X    then skip the ---info--- section.XX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information thatX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, anX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sampleX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include aX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for aX    'hints' file.XX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  ForX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailedX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,X    the entry should not require them exist.XX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid nameX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,X    say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If theyX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, sayX    so in the ---remark--- section.XX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry hasX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry shouldX    have entry number 0.XX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entryX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of theX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren'tX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in theX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:XX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address forX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)XX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems referX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that asX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:XX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993XX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  TheX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On manyX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:XX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"X\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'X\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'X\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'X\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'XX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, setX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry numberX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to beX    replaced.XXXJUDGING PROCESS:XX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.XX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email messageX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:XX\t---entry--- sectionX\tall ---author--- sectionsX\tall ---info--- sectionsX\t---build--- sectionX\t---program--- sectionX\tany other text, including the Email message headersXX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sureX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry wasX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from theX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process isX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.XX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particularX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you areX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of findingX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.XX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make allX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winningX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not evenX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCCX    winners at talks)XX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to theX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to giveX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented theirX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  WeX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.XX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that doesX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in theX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.XX    A reading consists of a number of actions:XX\t* reading the ---entry--- sectionX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- sectionX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- sectionX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if anyX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processorX\t    shipping over any #include filesX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the sourceX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processorX\t    shipping over any #include filesXX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:XX\t* linting the sourceX\t* compiling/building the sourceX\t* running the programX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binaryXX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entriesX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because itX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to formX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.X    An entry often will compete in several categories.XX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entriesX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:XX\t* best small one line programX\t* best small programX\t* strangest/most creative source layoutX\t* most useful obfuscated programX\t* best game that is obfuscatedX\t* most creatively obfuscated programX\t* most deceptive C codeX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)X\t* best abuse of ANSI CX\t* worst abuse of the rulesX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>XX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are soX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.XX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks ofX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it intoX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do notX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, isX    less clear cut.XX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat outX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it isX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entryX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!XX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), aX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contestX    rules in some way.XX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.

The number of charactersX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.XX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:XX---entry---Xrule:\t1993Xfix:\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)Xtitle:\ttitle of entry  \t\t    (see comments below)Xentry:\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)Xdate:\tDate/time of submission in UTC\t    (see comments below)Xhost:\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was testedX\tUse tab indented lines if neededX---remark---X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful ifX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not aX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79thX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.X---author---Xname:\tyour nameXorg:\tSchool/Company/OrganizationXaddr:\tpostal addressX\tuse tab indented lines to continueX\tdon't forget to include the countryXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.Xanon:\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)X---info---XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it inXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple infoXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.X---build---XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your programXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resultingXfile must be 255 bytes or less.X---program---XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecodeXinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.X---end---XX      Regarding the above format:XX\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*X\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.XX\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title shouldX\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,X\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.XX\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respectX\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() X\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)XX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sendingX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the X\t  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same X\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be X\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.XX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above X\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judgesX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separateX\t  Email message to the judges.XX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless X\t  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.XX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section forX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, andX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.XX\t* The entry's remarks should include:X\t    - what this program doesX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)X\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if anyX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)X\t    - information about any ---data--- filesX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscatedX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.X\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)XX\t* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certainX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.XX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They X\t  should not be required to exist.XX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---X\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple X\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describeX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.XX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:XX\t   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removedX\t   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optionalX\t       digit, followed by '.c'X\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry'sX\t       title, possibly followed by a digitXX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in yourX       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute aX       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name ofX       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followedX       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.XX       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry mustX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.XX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should beX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If thisX       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.XX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in theX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.XX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is Xgranted provided this this copyright and notice are included in its entirety Xand remains unaltered.  All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel.XXABOUT THIS FILE:XX    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries toX    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).XX    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments aboutX    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules areX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.XX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.XXXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:XX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.cX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.XX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI CX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.XXXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:XX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  SeeX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.XX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entriesX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one yearX    might be 'old' the next year.XX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically applyX    a number of tests to an entry:XX\t* look at the original sourceX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCIIX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' linesX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' linesX\t* run it through a C beautifierX\t* examine the algorithmX\t* lint itX\t* compile itX\t* execute itXX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has beenX    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.XX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certainX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for theX    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well asX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, givenX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry thatX    does something interesting when you run it.XX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leaveX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real lifeX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer requestX    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of theX    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.XX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us knowX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuseX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to theX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends toX    annoy more than amuse.XX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entriesX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to useX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)XX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes makeX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularlyX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen someX    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.XX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims thatX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better offX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th powerX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctlyX    working entry is best.XXXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:XX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  WeX    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor testsX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as farX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.XX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:XX\t#define d defineX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define fooXX\tint i;X\tj;\t\t   <-- don't use such implicit type declarationX\tint k;XX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.XX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:XX\tint i;X\tchar *c;X\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] insteadX\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] insteadXX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number ofX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide varietyX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list areX    not portable and must not be used:XX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variableX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variableX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list argX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list argX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variablesX\t* using va_list as a structure or unionXX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.XX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.XX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While someX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.XX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entriesX    must not assume that it returns an int.XX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they doX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that peopleX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look forX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.XX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.XX    We tend to dislike programs that:XX\t* are very hardware specificX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specificX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specificX\t      code is likely not to be)X\t* dump core or have compiler warningsX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)X\t* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*xX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limitX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphsX\t* are longer than they need to beX\t* are similar to previous winnersX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)XX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering theX    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your programX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.XX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the sizeX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order toX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feelX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better offX    if you show some amount of restraint.XX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impactX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to getX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.XX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blobX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical CX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a thirdX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interestingX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!XX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claimX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicatingX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)X    know of a smaller one!XX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries thatX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don'tX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't dependX    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.XX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries andX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X clientX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and theX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyoneX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  NotX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (orX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  BetterX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.XX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items onX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required linesX    in the ---remark--- section.XX    We like programs that:XX\t* are as concise and small as they need to beX\t* do something at least quasi-interestingX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)X\t* are portableX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation styleX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATIONX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)XX    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, yourX    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in severalX    areas really does help.XX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments inX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had toX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.XX    Be creative!XXXENTRY FORMAT:XX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request yourX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about theX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)XX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how toX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning thatX    is found in mkentry.c:XX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  EveryX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program producesX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,X\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, theX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with theX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.XX    You are not required to use mkentry.

If an entry wins, we will renameX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optionalX    digit in case of name conflicts.XX    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.XX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, sourceX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in theX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpfulX    if you did one of the following:XX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.XX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:XX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binaryXX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special sourceX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.cX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_nameXX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special buildX\t\ttail +4 build > special_buildX\t\tsh < special_buildXX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of X\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You X\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.XX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoidX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You shouldX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  ThisX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.XX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  WeX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If theX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode themX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,X    then skip the ---info--- section.XX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information thatX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, anX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sampleX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include aX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for aX    'hints' file.XX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  ForX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailedX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,X    the entry should not require them exist.XX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid nameX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,X    say so in the ---remark--- section.XX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If theyX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, sayX    so in the ---remark--- section.XX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry hasX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry shouldX    have entry number 0.XX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entryX    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of theX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren'tX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:XX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address forX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)X    X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:XX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993XX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  TheX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:XX\tdate -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\"X\tdate -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/'X\tsh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'X\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'X\tsh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"'XX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, setX    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry numberX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to beX    replaced.XXXJUDGING PROCESS:XX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.XX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email messageX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:XX\t---entry--- sectionX\tall ---author--- sectionsX\tall ---info--- sectionsX\t---build--- sectionX\t---program--- sectionX\tany other text, including the Email message headersXX    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sureX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry wasX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from theX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process isX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.XX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particularX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you areX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of findingX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.XX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make allX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winningX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not evenX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCCX    winners at talks)XX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to theX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to giveX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented theirX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  WeX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.XX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that doesX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in theX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.XX    A reading consists of a number of actions:XX\t* reading the ---entry--- sectionX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- sectionX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- sectionX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if anyX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processorX\t    shipping over any #include filesX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the sourceX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processorX\t    shipping over any #include filesXX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:XX\t* linting the sourceX\t* compiling/building the sourceX\t* running the programX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binaryXX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entriesX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because itX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to formX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.X    An entry often will compete in several categories.XX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entriesX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:XX\t* best small one line programX\t* best small programX\t* strangest/most creative source layoutX\t* most useful obfuscated programX\t* best game that is obfuscatedX\t* most creatively obfuscated programX\t* most deceptive C codeX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)X\t* best abuse of ANSI CX\t* worst abuse of the rulesX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>XX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are soX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.XX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks ofX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it intoX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do notX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, isX    less clear cut.XX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat outX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it isX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!XX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), aX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contestX    rules in some way.XX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes suchX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, theX    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.XXXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:XX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior toX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.XX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:XX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sourcesXX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the followingXX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.miscX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.xXX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  SeeX    below for details.XX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners X    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.XX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)XXXFOR MORE INFORMATION:XX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:XX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address forX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)XX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.XX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentryX    program.

Affected programs include rgb and the server.\tThis is from the GCC manual:\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \treference.\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for justthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags.  \tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \t\trgb/rgb.c\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args orreturn values:  \t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly harmless as they don't involve structs.[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do this simple test:\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\tSIOCGIFCONFRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gccsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

What should these be?\tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can addthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the Imakefile.

While building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; itattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic tomost C compilers).----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5libraries only applied to the documented interface).  A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis (jpf@heliocentric.com)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your systemadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) usedby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site.\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute pathsto the libraries.[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against thenewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suidprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhapsmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console display.

Although it is not specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process bywhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configurationfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not obvious.\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, andR5 versions are different.\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information onusing Imake to build X\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4guide to imake.\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by JimFulton on an early version of Imake\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.eduin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;mail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNuttin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make / I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing towrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in TheX Journal, issue 2:1.\t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article ondemystifying Imake.\t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with X11R5.\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imakewithout picking up the entire distribution.\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is inftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\tUndefined:\t_XShapeQueryExtension\t_XShapeCombineMask\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangularwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway.\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includeswill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you canprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X libraries.[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the error \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normallybe called.\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normalXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it calledXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and iscorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,although this will certainly solve the problem.\t[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); 11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under the current version of X, I get this message:\tUndefined:\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\t_XtTextReplace\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in additionto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions butare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.[10/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from onewindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask thewindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what arecalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, youcan use something like the following:        XWMHints wmhints;        ...        wmhints.flags = InputHint;        wmhints.input = True;        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't havesource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having this done. \tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resourceto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could bespoofed in any case. \tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking forparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to takeadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in orderto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;this surely leads to future compatibility problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\t\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Goodapplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just this one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point forquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 distributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget issensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\t{\tArg args[3];\tint i;\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\ti=0;\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\t...\t}But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; declaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if youuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.[11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code.They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for awidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, yourapplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted.\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation ofthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that nosuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources forthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the locationin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics aredefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget.\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.----------------------------------------------------------------------David B.

The more specific youare, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Withoutall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they areable to respond at all.\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and whatyou expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?\tThe trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)are publishing more articles on X.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager.  Get it either:\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book\t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X ProtocolReference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the presentation.[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\". The complete document is on the R5tapes.\tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \"RTFM\" and isthe most-important of the least-read X documents.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further thedevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\tMIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specificationis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortiumas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOKwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif wasdeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF members. \tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in thestyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (includingthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; anda number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, dxpsview, etc.).(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)[8/90] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  15)  What is PEX?\tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\".\tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3D graphics.\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sampleimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for their workstations and X terminals.[last modified 10/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?There are several options for using X over serial lines:SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IPpackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-pointlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation thanSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wirestill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originallydeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a pseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \tconnected), and   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\thave to cross the serial interface, and   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \tblocks to compress.LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on astandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBXwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in R6.Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on howLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.eduin contrib/ in the following files:        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk atthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of theX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there isno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in are-parenting window manager. \tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offerssome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlapand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the StyleGuide functionality\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-inLisp interpreter.

A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available from export.

It is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm.

What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager inthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconicor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming thegeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. Look for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.[10/90]\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-runningapplications and the resource database.

To override this, add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The Xprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which isa capability not supported by all systems.\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may providecommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to beproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and does not do \"macro expansion.\"\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, accept a translation resource such as:\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locallywithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include controlcharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of thecontrol character you want to include.\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; norhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.----------------------------------------------------------------------David B.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget andthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of othercallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leavingdangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\t\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answeris set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code dropsout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\t{\t\tint             answer;\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\");\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\t\t\t{\t\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\");\t\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\t\t\t\texit(0);                }\t}\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it.\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop andwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to thecalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \"OK\", \"Cancel\" and \"Help\" or equivalents:  int AskUser(w, string)        Widget          w;        char           *string;  {        int             answer=RET_NONE;\t/* some not-used marker */        Widget          dialog;\t\t\t/* could cache&carry, but ...*/        Arg             args[3];        int             n = 0;        XtAppContext    context;        n=0;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);        XtManageChild(dialog);        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);        }        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */        return answer;  }\tThe dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices:  void response(w, client, call)        Widget          w;        XtPointer client;        XtPointer call;  {  int *answer = (int *) client;  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;        switch (reason->reason) {        case XmCR_OK:                *answer = RET_YES;\t/* some #define value */                break;        case XmCR_CANCEL:                *answer = RET_NO; \t\tbreak;        case XmCR_HELP:                *answer = RET_HELP;                break;        default:                return;        }}and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed andcontinues from there.[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contribWidgetWrap library. 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.\tUsers of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.\tIf you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want.

It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can takethe following steps to avoid the error:1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab theimage from the pixmap.5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good.6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?\tA number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straightcharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it isrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:\t\tdisplay = XOpenDisplay(display_name);\tif (display)\t\t{ do X stuff }\telse\t\t{ do curses or something else }where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 128)  How do I make a \"busy cursor\" while my application is computing?Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?\tThe easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):     unsigned long valuemask;     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than32767.When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back tonormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouseevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may nothave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change thecursor without blocking pointer events.[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller (argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. \tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \t\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));to close the file-descriptor in the display information.

If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leavethe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard pointsout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific toXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may becalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupthandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event whichhas previously been added.\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\tIt's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor.\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use onlynon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there isnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginningand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almostalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data:\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;Ollie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not settingthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widgetwhich should receive the event.\t If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that youavoid a round-trip to the server.\tDepending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to callits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.[courtesy Mark A.

However, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped:  while (!done)    {      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);      switch (the_event.type) {\tcase Expose:\t /* On expose events, redraw */\t\tXDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);\t\tbreak;\t...\t}    }\tNote that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code:  ...  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);  ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background.And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based programif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it maynot yet have appeared.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\tThe 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information aboutone of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection.\tThe macros which you can use to obtain information about the particularScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- onewhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\tIn Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\t(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macroswhich return characteristics of the Screen have \"Display\" in the names -- XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\t----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\tNote that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate thepixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

Note that there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\".\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparentwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your applicationwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colorsthat will appear properly.[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see alsoThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for thislast option]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on abackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawingoperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color thatthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visuallyrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Blackand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematicalcoincidence will break.]\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosenpre-computed values.\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley (whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\tMake sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.

I want to check whetherthe window exists before doing anything with it.\tBecause X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent anevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send theevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists.

The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, exceptfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of theapplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID intoit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it alsoknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the firstapplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentionedin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. \tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection.

You have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can deferactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-clickbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the casein your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromisecheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, shouldbe the single-click action or the double-click action.[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?\t\tXlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphicslibraries.\tYour only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is torender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \"by hand\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically:\t1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.\t2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).\t3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.\t4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where \t\ta = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\t\tb = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\t5) render I2\tNote that you should be careful how you implement this not to losebits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.\tThe high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use thesame fonts that would be found on a printer.\tIn addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a fonton it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at somepredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of eachglyph.[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor (etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;Liam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]\tInterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support forrendering rotated fonts in X.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire currentdisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has anundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]is the most recent.\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpris available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is availablefrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2psand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z andcontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archiveservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, andsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\tAlso: \tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.netin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers.\tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portionof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, aversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 availablevia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, readsand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some imagemanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu ascontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has alibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and displayimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFFfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was writtento handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remainingsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problemswith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributedas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available onexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.\tA version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing toolis available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The current (R4) guide includes an outdated versionof the control sequences. [1/93]Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that documentand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.[last updated 10/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \tXTerm*font: \t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\tXTerm*boldfont:\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') is Alt-'.

If you give a resource specification like this:\t\txterm*geometry: 80x24then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set onlythe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\t\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for manipulating the selection will help; e.g. \t% xselection PRIMARY | lprfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting ofthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can beadapted to do this.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at mostone app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another fromthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever yourOPENWINHOME is located):\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%NThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                application's class name.        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the                literal string \"app-defaults\"        %C      customization resource (R5 only)        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")        %t      The territory part of the display's language string        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the applicationfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loadedproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and%S are useless.\tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot inthis batch of default settings.)\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%N:\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run aprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdbwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\t#!/bin/sh\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file andsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by startingyour .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\". \tIf this doesn't work, also try starting off with:\t\t#!/bin/sh\t\t# Reset path:\t\tPATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\"whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, andxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\t\teval `xrlogind`where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables. [11/90]\tIn addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on another host, and you find\t\trsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote X processes.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X Journal for more information.\tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font formatand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; aversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produceBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed [5/91] in export:/contrib. \tIf you are a MetaFont user you can use \"mftobdf\" from the SeeTeXdistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distributionis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.\tThe GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.\tThe O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using thesetools to modify a font.\tFonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version isin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?\tAfter you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts inthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in the path.)\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, orthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (Themention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find   it, run bldfamily(1).)-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work   for X11Rn.[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  40)  How do I convert a \".snf\" font back to \".bdf\" font?\tA tool called \"snftobdf 1.4\" is part of the bdftools package, which is available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\tder Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\tIn addition, the R5 program \"fstobdf\" can produce bdf for any font thatthe R5 server has access to.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\tThe DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications tostandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers which do not use the MIT font scheme.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  43)  How do I add \".bdf\" fonts to my DECwindows server?\tThe format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \".pcf\" format.You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfcfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with aperformance hit.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)I want to be able to do something like this:\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets, however.[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]However:\tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap.\tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, byAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want toallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See informationon the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and isavailable from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.\tYou probably have an extra space after the specification of the first item, like this:\tbasic*text.translations:  #override \\\tCtrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\n\\ \t\tCtrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()\t\t\t\t\t      ^ extra spaceThe newline after that space is ending the translation definition.[Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?\tOne solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can showthe time for timezones other than the local one. \tAlternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell fromwhich you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:\t#!/bin/sh\tTZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\" 2> /dev/null &\tTZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \"King_Of_Prussia_PA\" 2> /dev/null &----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?\tThe xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system,which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list, you can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh, by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request\"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\".----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server?After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, noother clients are able to connect to it.\tThe default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)delete \"old\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add \"! -type s\" tothe find exclusion in the cron job.[10/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen?The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun? Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MITdoesn't do this but there are two different patches available. The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the filecontrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z . The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keysand adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu incontrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se. [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?\tGenerally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied youwith the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look inmit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.][Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  52)  Why do I get \"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\"?\tThis error, which typically goes on to say, \"widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003\" indicates that the header files you included when building your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.\tHowever, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OWsystems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings youhave seen.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?\tWebster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster'sDictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became awarethat these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.\t[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. AWebster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in \"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\".]\tUnless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a sitewhich can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. \tHowever, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up thelatest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and non-availability of dictionary servers. \t[courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels Mayer) 11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?\tNo. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not \"public domain\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.\tContributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain byindividual authors.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)?Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from Software Center, Technology Licensing Office, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 28 Carleton Street, Room E32-300, Cambridge MA 02142-1324,phone: 617-258-8330.You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to holdthe Contrib software donated by individuals and companies.

Xt Glossary----------------------------------------------------------------------o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the  Intrinsics are not especially useful.o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless  widgets or gadgets.o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib  functions because Xt provides most such services although an  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?----------------------------------------------------------------------In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion forcritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one ofthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all theappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of alist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out thatbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problemspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions otherfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed thatthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in theinterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by awork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add eitherof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerousto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectivelypreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will neverbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loopabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handlercan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because itis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operatingsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'ReillyVolume 6 are in error.----------------------------------------------------------------------4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?----------------------------------------------------------------------This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window hasthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap andborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmapresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questionsdeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of theseresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In theshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreenand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources isnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window iscreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values dependson the visual being used.  How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  Thefirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visualand the second is if you want a particular shell within an applicationto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easierbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is alittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkityourself in order to determine the needed information./* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>#include <X11/StringDefs.h>#include <X11/Shell.h>typedef struct{\tVisual\t*visual;\tint\tdepth;} OptionsRec;OptionsRec\tOptions;XtResource resources[] ={\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},};XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] ={\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}};intmain (argc, argv)\tint\t\targc;\tchar\t\t**argv;{\tXtAppContext\tapp;\t\t/* the application context */\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\t/* toplevel widget */\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\t\t/* display */\tchar\t\t**xargv;\t/* saved argument vector */\tint\t\txargc;\t\t/* saved argument count */\tColormap\tcolormap;\t/* created colormap */\tXVisualInfo\tvinfo;\t\t/* template for find visual */\tXVisualInfo\t*vinfo_list;\t/* returned list of visuals */\tint\t\tcount;\t\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\tArg\t\targs[10];\tCardinal\tcnt;\tchar\t\t*name = \"test\";\tchar\t\t*class = \"Test\";\t/*\t * save the command line arguments\t */\txargc = argc;\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\t/*\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\t */\tcnt = 0;\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\t\t\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\tcnt = 0;\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\t\t\t\t   XtNumber (resources),\t\t\t\t   args, cnt);\tcnt = 0;\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\t{\t\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\t\t/*\t\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there isno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has tobe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then yourapplication probably falls into the category of always using thedefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particularvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or somesuch).Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a serverallocates resources I may not always want your application to run inTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I maybe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColoror just monochrome.As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many differentpossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, staticcolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.----------------------------------------------------------------------6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrarywidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for theshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of thatshell.A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must haveits own realize method to use the visual when it callsXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can beobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  Areasonable value is probably XtNvisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?----------------------------------------------------------------------The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  Thisis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copiescolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as thevisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?----------------------------------------------------------------------Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This wasespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.----------------------------------------------------------------------9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  TheIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and allof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way anypending X events or further references to that widget can be cleanedup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is thenperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions havecompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point thelist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, amongother things.As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if theIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to thewidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occursimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed onthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are notdestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.----------------------------------------------------------------------10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?----------------------------------------------------------------------The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exitingan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widgetmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as opensockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code forsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\tWidget\tToplevelGet (gw)\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\t\t\t/* empty */;\t\treturn (top);\t}\tvoid\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\t\texit (0);\t}One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroyingthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may neveroccur.  This works for most widgets and most applications but will not workfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think thatsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of thereason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorantof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that thewidget may change and someday require that some external state iscleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag andthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, privateevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, anddifficult to maintain practices.Try the following code instead.\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\t\tWidget\t\tgw\t#endif\t);\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\t#endif\t);\textern void ExitCallback (\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\t#endif\t);\tWidget\tToplevelGet (gw)\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\t\t\t/* empty */;\t\treturn (top);\t}\tvoid\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\t}\tBoolean\tExitWorkProc (closure)\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t{\t\texit (0);\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\t}ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when theapplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events areprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.----------------------------------------------------------------------11. How do I resize a Shell widget?----------------------------------------------------------------------After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The properthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widgetusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to theShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow therequest.  However, the Shell must have the resourceXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask thewindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, notthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.----------------------------------------------------------------------12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?----------------------------------------------------------------------It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file doesnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a filedescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would notblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not toblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  Fora file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics alwayscalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about tobe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV basedOS's it is the poll() system call.How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to useanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipeto connect the application with this other process and pass the filedescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program onBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_reliable.  In particular:\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\t  been given the whole block).Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such asread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area andmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designersfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included withpart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at thispoint I don't know.----------------------------------------------------------------------13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?----------------------------------------------------------------------I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspectiveit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the fulldetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was alreadyfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or maynot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, whichmeans its a 1000 pages.Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6.

What Widgets are available?----------------------------------------------------------------------There are three popular widget sets:Athena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.Motif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\t  it is poorly implemented.OLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:Xtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\t  them so I can't comment.FWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.Xcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.

How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\ttypdef struct\t{\t\t    String\tname;\t    long\tvalue;\t} Arg;and the code:\tArg\targ;\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)expands to\tArg\targ;\targ.name = \"name\";\targ.value = 3.2;you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.valuegets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  Whenthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern iswildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,how to get around this?The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am nowrecomending it over the previous suggestions.#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\    } else { \\        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\    }----------------------------------------------------------------------17. How do I write a resource converter?----------------------------------------------------------------------Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allowfor destructors and caching of converted values.There are several main types of resource converters:    string to data type    data type to string    data type to data typei) string to data type    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\tName\t\tValue\t\"True\"\t\t1\t\"False\"\t\t0    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one    of the converters.ii) data type to string    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,    probably by the use of sprintf.    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure    that they are consistent.iii) data type to data type    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for    red, green and blue.The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);    Display *dpy;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;    XrmValuePtr fromVal;    XrmValuePtr toVal;    XtPointer *converter_data;When the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the sourceX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to thedestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argumentis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specifiedwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" argumentsallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it isinvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussedabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup thePixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.Care must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has thefollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for aconverted value:typedef struct {    unsigned int    size;    caddr_t         addr;} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location ofthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of thedestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  Ifthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter shouldset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  Thecaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke theconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simplycopy the converted value into the space given and return True.If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location tothe address of a static variable containing the converted value andreturn True.When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and itbecomes convenient to define a macro:    #define DONE(var, type) \\      if (toVal->addr) \\\t{ \\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\t    { \\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\t      return False; \\\t    } \\\t  else \\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\t} \\      else \\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\      return True;    #define DONESTR(str) \\      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\t{ \\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\t  return False; \\\t} \\      else \\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\      return True;Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safetychecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that yourconverter is being called properly.Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with theIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creatingwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.To register a converter with a single application context, useXtAppSetTypeConverter:void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\tcache, destructor)    XtAppContext context;    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;To register a converter with all application contexts, useXtSetTypeConverter:void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\tcache, destructor)    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter andXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverterand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should beused.When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argumentspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basisCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is agood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).The \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then theresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count hasbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value isbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);    XtAppContext context;    XrmValuePtr to;    XtPointer converter_data;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associatedwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointedto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passedthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when theconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual argumentsfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need tofree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the privatedata passed in when the converter was registered.Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MITR5 distribution:    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h----------------------------------------------------------------------18. How do I open multiple displays?----------------------------------------------------------------------See \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issuesinvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In anutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each displayand remove it from the application context.The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This canhappen 3 ways:\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ aproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing thatdisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on theOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficultproblem.The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/Oerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially truefor a single display X based application, but not true for amultiple display program or an application that does things other thandisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs theI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoidreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragmentdemonstrates this:#include <setjmp.h>jmp_buf XIOrecover;voidXIOHandler (dpy)\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;{\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);}main (){\t...\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);}The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can goback to the application specific data and perform any necessarycleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() isfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in thejmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program tothe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return valueof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument tolongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for thispurpose it is adequate.Some other problems you might run into are resource converters thatimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errorssuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with thetotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limitednumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typicalvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying toconnect to a display.There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic inNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basicallysaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.----------------------------------------------------------------------19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?----------------------------------------------------------------------This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the generalchanges for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete,list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated arelisted.

Where are the resources loaded from?----------------------------------------------------------------------The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places(from highest priority to lowest priority):\t1. Args passed at creation time.\t2. Command line arguments.\t3. User's per host defaults file\t4. User's defaults file.\t5. User's per application default file.\t6. System wide per application default file.Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The resultof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.The per host defaults file contains customizations for allapplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is eitherspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is notset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGERproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set thenthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" isused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that thisshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to thedisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte isreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGERbut most do not.A user may have many per application default files containingcustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quiteflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describesthe various environment variables and how they effect where this fileis found.The system wide per application default files are typically found in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then thefallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on howthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the variousenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]You can use several environment variables to control how resources areloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variablescontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as anapplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults filefrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the pathdefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such away that app-defaults files appear in several different directoryhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's OpenWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this forXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults filesin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever yourOPENWINHOME is located):\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%NThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list ofpathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows(see XtResolvePathname()):\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\t\tapplication's class name.\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language stringLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/MytermAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the aboveapp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, itreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect ofthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.Let's consider another example. This time, let's setXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the currentworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%NThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expandsto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting fordebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming theapp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, soyou can run the application from the directory in which you areworking and still have the resources loaded properly.NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is      defined so %T and %S are useless.With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customizationresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" applicationlike this:\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"If one of your pathname specifications had the value\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitutioncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in thisbatch of default settings.)The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%N:<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directoryif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to somevalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application findyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to setXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery workeddifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIRvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.----------------------------------------------------------------------21. What order are callbacks executed in?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is becauseboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability tomodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither onecurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannotguarantee the order of execution.The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; thewidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add andremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;therefore the functionality contained in a callback should beindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on thelist.Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallbacksays: \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the \tprocedure is to be appended.\" you may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routinesare called in the same order as they have been added to the callbacklist.----------------------------------------------------------------------22. How do I know if a widget is visible?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag> stays set to TRUE.Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of theprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, inthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this sectioncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes fromviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something> else which needs to be done?You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest> way to determine if a window is iconified? As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an actionroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widgetwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see themap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These aresuggestions.----------------------------------------------------------------------23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------You can't.----------------------------------------------------------------------24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?----------------------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it ishandled something like:\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\tif (!ptr)\t{\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\t\texit (1)\t}To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functionsXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() whichall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() andrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xterror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it usesXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\tif (!ptr)\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\telse\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\t++count;to be written as:\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I'vefound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'mallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions soI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating astructure or copying a string:\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\t  char\t     *ptr;\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow animplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable withmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\t char\t      *ptr;\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\t /* ... */\t free (ptr);may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did thisbroken and complain to the vendor.A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a stringwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().----------------------------------------------------------------------25. How to debug an Xt application?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is agreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit priceyat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb(contact support@pure.com for more info).\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs onmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL DebuggingEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C libraryfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.comfor more info)Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run insynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command lineargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Thenset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to theoriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronousmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls toXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from theserver are asynchronous.Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use theundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.For example:    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &    example% xwininfo -tree\t     <click in new xload window>will give the normal information but the widget name and class of eachwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and sizeof errant widgets.Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want totest the way a widget manages it's children, you can tryexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filterbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviourof both.  It's a very clever idea.The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while theapplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as froma pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need togo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The serverlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one elsecan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stoppedwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going toyour application which is stopped.The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines onyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)on one machine, and running the application on the other, possiblyusing a command sequence like this:\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\tor this:\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\tthismachine% gdb application\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\t(gdb) run ...I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a methodof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions torelease any grabs during breakpoints.Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills andknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowingthe internals of a particular widget but not very far withoutunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditionalbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a greatdeal.----------------------------------------------------------------------26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?----------------------------------------------------------------------   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted thoseroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens isthey use a default application context different then the one you mayhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a perapplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,you won't get those events.For example:\t...\tcnt = 0;\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\tXtAppMainLoop (app)would never invoke the timeout.----------------------------------------------------------------------27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an``intuitive'' fashion.Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook hassupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable witheach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible publicprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  Myintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people tosupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they developand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as longas it is based on Xt).The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCMconventions, for more details read the code.I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel thatit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem tobe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motifanyway.The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp fromnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

These  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the  performance of your workstation.  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more  hardware is always even a necessity.  This \"FAQ\" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.  However, they are outside the scope of this document.    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook    \"System Performance Tuning\" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written    comprehensive treatment of system performance.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few  months old (see the \"Last-modified\" date above) you should probably  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates  on performance.  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).---------------Window Managers---------------  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate  for a speedy window manager.   A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.------------The X Server------------Which Server?- - - - - - -  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute  to less paging.           [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial  compilers on the market.Locking the Server into RAM?- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]Starting your Server- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!    Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of  why this works, which I have summarized here:    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself    sorted out before the clients start up.    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your    workstation's limited resources  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients  you are starting, etc.  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &  I've experimented with:\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &  I've even tried:\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients    were launched. ]  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.Fonts- - -  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer  fonts will be loaded by the server.\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.About the Resources File- - - - - - - - - - - - -    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)  One suggestion:    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.    --ed.]    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files    with the same name.    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following  benefits:    - Easier to maintain / more usable.    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort       through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.  It also has drawbacks:    - the application that you are interested in has to load an      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to      make that much of a performance difference, and you might      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*      provide any error message when it encountered the C style      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted      processing the resource file.      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this      method of resource management.    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for  clients that I seldom use.Define Your Display Properly- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to   \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further  explanation of how to properly set your display name.  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]-------Clients-------  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there  a smaller clock program than xclock?  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in  more than one toolkit library.  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client  programs would work best together in that environment.\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]A Better Clock for X- - - - - - - - - - -1) xcuckoo   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.

I suspect that  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),\t\t   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]1) Xvt   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z   \"...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as   xterm is rather a hog! \"   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any   yet.   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets   brought into memory.   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif  Text Field Widgets:    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference    on a [slower system].  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server  requests?-------------------------Miscellaneous Suggestions-------------------------Pretty Pictures- - - - - - - -  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]A Quicker Mouse- - - - - - - -  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.    e.g. (for twm) :      menu \"mouse settings\" {        \"Mouse Settings:\"\t\t\tf.title\t\"  Very Fast\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\t\t\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\t! \"xset m default &\"\t\"  Glacial\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"      }Programming Thoughts- - - - - - - - - - -  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of    things you can do.  Some that stick out:    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE      difference.    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable      one.  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to    run through it's event-loop again and again.  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).Say What!?- - - - - -   Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the    same operation between client and server.  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received  the following confirmation...  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was    essential when I only had 8 MB.  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your    action.    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing    even fewer context switches.----------------------------Other Sources of Information----------------------------  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X    Application Performance\" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in    Issue 3 of The X Resource.    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992    conference proceedings.    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.--------------Author & Notes--------------  This list is currently maintained by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)  Suggestions, corrections, or submission for inclusion in this list  are gladly accepted.

Free options\tThe BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.\tAny other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will\tbe more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86\tis listed below.\tX386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was\tdone by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).\tIt supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.\tThere are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,\tX386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you\tdon't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).\tX386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).2.

What is XFree86?   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately       20% faster than X386 1.2.    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about       the ATI and Trident drivers.    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary       distributions.    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA       cards is now included.   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200        (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for       more information.)    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some        versions of these devices were not previously compatible).    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous       documentation and a lot of experimentation).    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many        vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more        information).    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)        manual page for more information on the format of this file).       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file       in the source distribution for full details.   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.4. What OSs are supported?    XFree86 supports:\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au5. What video hardware is supported?   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\tTseng ET4000\tTseng ET3000\tParadise PVGA1\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\t\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\tGenoa GVGA\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\tATI 18800, 28800\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\t256 color mode.\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\tfuture XFree86 releases.\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\twork with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\tworking fine on them.6. What about accelerated boards?\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \tlower bound.9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\t\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\t\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\t\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\t\t- SVR4 binaries\t\t\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\t\tftp.win.tue.nl\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\t\tferkel.ucsb.edu\t\t\t- SVR4 binaries\t\t\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\t\tstasi.bradley.edu\t\t- SVR4 binaries\t\t\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\t\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\t\t\tunder /pub/ISC\t\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\t\t\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\t\ttsx-11.mit.edu\t\t\t- Linux binaries\t\t\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\t\tagate.berkeley.edu\t\t- 386BSD binaries\t\t\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\t\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\t\t\t- Mach binaries\t\t\tunder /i386\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\tmade when building the distribution.IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?11. Installation directories\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.12. Configuration files\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\tIf this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\tNOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\t      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\t      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\t      starting the server in the future.14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).15. SVR4\tWhy won't my xterm run properly?\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.\tcsh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.16. SVR3\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.17. 386BSD\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.218. Linux\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\tjump libraries installed.\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\tIf your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\t-pn argument to X386.\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\tstartx won't.\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.19. Mach\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?20. BSD compatibility library\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\tseed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a21. ANSICCOPTIONS\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see\tsomething like\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\t\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\t\tANSICCOPTIONS=\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\twith -ansi).

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announcedin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from othersites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in their source distributions of X11.\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\t\tsend fixes #where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\tHere are a few complications:\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \"5d\" separately\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which previously was optional\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuffby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail it a request, and it mails back the response.\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. Thexstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). The xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line of the message.\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file.\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. Ifthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. For example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that requests an index cannot request data.\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then thexstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name an item, you give its directory and its name. For example                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixedamount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out shortest-first.\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.eduor        path bar!foo!frotzin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If your mailer deals in \"!\" notation, try sending to {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.[based on information from the MIT X Consortium, 8/89, 4/90.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  60)!

If\tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\trules.\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\t``CEC''.\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\tequivalent NEC publications.\tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\tthe province.Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\tfind one willing to supervise.\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\tand will impress the inspector.\tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\tbecome very brittle.Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?\tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\twork well).\t\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\taccurate.\tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\tthat you'll gouge the conductors.\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\tor the insulation.\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\tthat has no cover plate).Subject: What is UL listing?\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\tthat it probably won't kill you.\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\toccupancy permits issued.\tSubject: What is CSA approval?\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\trequired by law.\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\tclaim.\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\tcompanies.Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\t    Residential Wiring\t    by Jeff Markell,\t    Craftsman Books,\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\t    Wiring Simplified\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\t    Park Publishing Co.\t\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\tquestions on the net ;-).\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\tthis.\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\tclaims.\tIn general, the process goes like this:\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\tDo I have to upgrade?\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\tlow.\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...Subject: What does an electrical service look like?\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere. \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\tnormally carries no current.\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\tinspector.\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\twell.\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\tservice).Subject: What is a circuit?\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\tair conditioners.\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\tpermissible.]\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\talternative to GFCI protection.Subject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\ttogether in the panel.\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\tequipment itself won't cause a fire.\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\treplaced.\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\tpurpose.\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\tcan often cause severe damage.Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\tpenny\" trick.\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\tBreakers don't do this.\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\tif you need one.Subject: What size wire should I use?\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\theat easily:\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\t\t14\t\t15\t\t12\t\t20\t\t10\t\t30\t\t8\t\t40\t\t6\t\t65\t\tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\ton the application and precise wire type.Subject: Where do these numbers come from?\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\truns.\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\twire.Subject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.Subject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\tused?\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\tsecure.\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\tthe circuit.\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\tGFCI happy.\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\tlaundry appliances.\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\tground...Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\tprong the terminating screw connects to.Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\tfrom downstream outlets.Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\tfairly resistant to damage.\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\tsheath.\t\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\tbut this is technically illegal.]\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\tand CEC):\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\t      in the breach...]\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\t      similar finish.\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\t      than 1m (39\").\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\tthe insulation.\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\tsolid wall coverings.\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\twire.\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\twiring section.] \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that \tpurpose.\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\t \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US, \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\t\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\t\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.Subject: Junction box positioning?\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\tget nasty.Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\tmounted between the joists.\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\tlong)\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\tin later.]\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\tfor the sensor can vary.\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\tand have them come and check out the problem.\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\tthan 50 feet long.Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\tmore current than it can continuously.\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\t       on BX cable.\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\tShould the test button work?\tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\tit, and promised to investigate.)Subject: How should I wire my shop?\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\twrong.\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\thave a different idea.\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.Subject: Underground Wiring\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\tyour specific situation.\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.Subject: Aluminum wiring\tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\twiring.\tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\tcause a fire.\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\tfor the following things:\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\t       up each connection.\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\t       be repaired.\t    \t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\t       you can rent the tool.\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\t    \t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\t       (not nicked) wire etc.    \tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\tYou can do this yourself too.Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\tHere's some hints on what to look for:\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\t\t  proper marking.\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\t\t  a GFCI)\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\t\t- Switched neutrals\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-)\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\t\t  ceiling\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wiresSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\t\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\tcolour as the hot wires.\tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\tComments on K&T:\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\t\t  quite good condition.\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\t\t  any circuit.\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\t\t  that contain K&T.\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\t\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\t\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\ttubing.\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.Subject: Where do I buy stuff?\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\tknow what you're talking about.

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentiallydouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I usedpreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in HamRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be usedat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved designof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count onreceive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so Ididn't bother with it.  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radiosactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps andspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the datastream is another matter entirely.  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flowdue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIOalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Eventhough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytesof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 ofa second.  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step inand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (BorlandIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in theproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and runninglow on resources of time, money and energy.  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CWID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on SonomaMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontallypolarized.  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costlyapproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones andyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can'tarrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I thinkyou'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused bymultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spreadspectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.73Glenn Elmore n6gnN6GN @ K3MC      amateur IP:\tglenn@SantaRosa.ampr.orgInternet:\tglenne@sr.hp.com \n",

I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be working with Open Look in the future.     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A.      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch.      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice.      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup.Cheers....

OK ?Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry          conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one          side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the          energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of         energy that carnot will give them.         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent         radioactive pollution of the environment !            -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.    -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) manyfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations wereadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\").  3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generallynot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossilplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual >boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plantsof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible inorder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure isnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It isdesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocitycauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowestpressure condensing environment is always the best.  A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (wherethe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since thecondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash intosteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is aparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at allcosts.  The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plantin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get inthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term isused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling towersystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river wateris pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higherhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce thecondenser area.At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in theair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the dischargewater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge waterfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature andhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river watertemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successfulin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for theplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature getstoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessivepressure.>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity andfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understoodthe costs of impure water.  By \"impure\", I mean water with a fewdozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolvedoxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory.John-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  unobjectionable).

When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the coolingtower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside airwill condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is thenreformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companiesare forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires theraw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attackby lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the propertyrather than the edge of the cooling tower.

Around the base of the hourglass is aring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenserin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled throughthe tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  Thesensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force fordraft generation.It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used onboth fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used parttime, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typicallytakes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

Thedetector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on theroof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.

Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (thelocal oscillator). Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways toreceiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local oscfrequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Sincethe AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...I think you get the picture.\n",

Thedetector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on theroof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.

Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (thelocal oscillator). Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways toreceiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local oscfrequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Sincethe AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...I think you get the picture.\n",

Old style wiring\tWhere do I buy stuff?Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers\tAlthough we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not\telectricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If\tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\trules.\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\t``CEC''.\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\tequivalent NEC publications.\tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\tthe province.Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\tfind one willing to supervise.\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\tand will impress the inspector.\tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\tbecome very brittle.Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?\tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\twork well).\t\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\taccurate.\tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\tthat you'll gouge the conductors.\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\tor the insulation.\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\tthat has no cover plate).Subject: What is UL listing?\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\tthat it probably won't kill you.\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\toccupancy permits issued.\tSubject: What is CSA approval?\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\trequired by law.\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\tclaim.\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\tcompanies.Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\t    Residential Wiring\t    by Jeff Markell,\t    Craftsman Books,\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25.

Which is currently 1990.\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\tquestions on the net ;-).\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\tthis.\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\tclaims.\tIn general, the process goes like this:\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\tDo I have to upgrade?\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\tlow.\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...Subject: What does an electrical service look like?\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere. \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\tnormally carries no current.\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\tinspector.\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\twell.\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\tservice).Subject: What is a circuit?\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\tair conditioners.\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\tpermissible.]\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\talternative to GFCI protection.Subject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\ttogether in the panel.\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\tequipment itself won't cause a fire.\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\treplaced.\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\tpurpose.\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\tcan often cause severe damage.Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\tpenny\" trick.\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\tBreakers don't do this.\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\tif you need one.Subject: What size wire should I use?\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\theat easily:\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\t\t14\t\t15\t\t12\t\t20\t\t10\t\t30\t\t8\t\t40\t\t6\t\t65\t\tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\ton the application and precise wire type.Subject: Where do these numbers come from?\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\truns.\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\twire.Subject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.Subject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\tused?\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\tsecure.\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\tthe circuit.\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\tGFCI happy.\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\tlaundry appliances.\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\tground...Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\tprong the terminating screw connects to.Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\tfrom downstream outlets.Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\tfairly resistant to damage.\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\tsheath.\t\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\tbut this is technically illegal.]\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\tand CEC):\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\t      in the breach...]\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\t      similar finish.\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\t      than 1m (39\").\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\tthe insulation.\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\tsolid wall coverings.\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\twire.\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\twiring section.] \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that \tpurpose.\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\t \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US, \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\t\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\t\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.Subject: Junction box positioning?\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\tget nasty.Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\tmounted between the joists.\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\tlong)\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\tin later.]\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\tfor the sensor can vary.\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\tand have them come and check out the problem.\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\tthan 50 feet long.Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\tmore current than it can continuously.\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\t       on BX cable.\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\tShould the test button work?\tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\tit, and promised to investigate.)Subject: How should I wire my shop?\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\twrong.\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\thave a different idea.\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.Subject: Underground Wiring\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\tyour specific situation.\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.Subject: Aluminum wiring\tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\twiring.\tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\tcause a fire.\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\tfor the following things:\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\t       up each connection.\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\t       be repaired.\t    \t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\t       you can rent the tool.\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\t    \t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\t       (not nicked) wire etc.    \tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\tYou can do this yourself too.Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\tHere's some hints on what to look for:\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\t\t  proper marking.\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\t\t  a GFCI)\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\t\t- Switched neutrals\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-)\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\t\t  ceiling\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wiresSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\t\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\tcolour as the hot wires.\tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\tComments on K&T:\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\t\t  quite good condition.\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\t\t  any circuit.\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\t\t  that contain K&T.\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\t\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\t\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\ttubing.\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.Subject: Where do I buy stuff?\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.

      "\tFrom: schmidt@auvax1.adelphi.eduSubject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiringLines: 163Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NYThere has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and groundingpractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, orthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, tocarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit thevoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  Itshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry thenormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters inthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the groundingconductor.  Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltageson the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the groundingconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used forthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and inmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should readboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications oninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulatedgrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductorsback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the serviceentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Manyof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not providea safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which isreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to bewhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground inmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrancepanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many householdservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  Inthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the groundingconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distancefrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small butmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Sincethere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipmenthas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does notpresent a shock hazard.  HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, youwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible insome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire ofinadequate size, causing it to overheat.With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which mayflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, whichincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, oftencausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path backto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fusesquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from thedwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of itflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may causecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in thewater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, notit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at anysub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in thisapplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to thegrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bondingscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperatewire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the daysbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want tohave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want tohave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in placeof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, thewires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,it's primarily for lightning protection.People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal groundingconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is.  Anywherethere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run underthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut thisaluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bondinglocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the emptysheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't havethe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance andinductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside thegreenfield.\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremoldbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold andthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiatorhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run aground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to thebox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outletswhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have theprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don'tinstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It isdesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungroundedGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might berenumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much moreto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

For 99.9% of the things youcan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers theywere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memoryperiodically.With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should beless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longerrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for theirequipment.

No.  No.  NOOO!!!The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in itunder normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop init either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even ifyou're grounded in some other way at the same time.  The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return forthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If youplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for thingslike sub-panels.)What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking andnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) andyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.

If the ground connections on the outlets areconnected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to themain panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house groundrod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one ofthe goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hotto the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.

First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection.Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wireshouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is thetranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with thegrounded center-tap the neutral.

OK ?Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry          conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one          side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the          energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of         energy that carnot will give them.         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent         radioactive pollution of the environment !            -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.    -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have         1.5 mRem.

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plantsof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible inorder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure isnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It isdesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocitycauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowestpressure condensing environment is always the best.  A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (wherethe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since thecondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash intosteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is aparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at allcosts.  The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plantin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get inthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term isused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling towersystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river wateris pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higherhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce thecondenser area.At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in theair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the dischargewater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge waterfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature andhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river watertemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successfulin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for theplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature getstoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessivepressure.>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity andfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understoodthe costs of impure water.  By \"impure\", I mean water with a fewdozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolvedoxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory.John-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

To assist coolingand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over thehot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster thanjust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor israpidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequentlyseen rising out of these towers.That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there becauseit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate ofthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steamsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to theboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference acrossthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are andby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending itback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\"turbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  unobjectionable).

Contact with the cool outside airwill condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is thenreformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companiesare forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires theraw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%.

Around the base of the hourglass is aring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenserin the plant, is sprayed over louvres.

Thesensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force fordraft generation.It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used onboth fossile and nuclear plants.

I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be working with Open Look in the future.     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A.      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch.      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice.      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup.Cheers....

OK ?Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry          conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one          side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the          energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of         energy that carnot will give them.         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent         radioactive pollution of the environment !            -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.    -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) manyfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations wereadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go.\").  3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generallynot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossilplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual >boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water,>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal >pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plantsof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible inorder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure isnormally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It isdesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocitycauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowestpressure condensing environment is always the best.  A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (wherethe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since thecondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash intosteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is aparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at allcosts.  The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plantin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get inthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term isused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling towersystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river wateris pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higherhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce thecondenser area.At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in theair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the dischargewater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge waterfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature andhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river watertemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successfulin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for theplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature getstoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessivepressure.>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is >purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when>the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than >cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity andfeeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understoodthe costs of impure water.  By \"impure\", I mean water with a fewdozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolvedoxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory.John-- John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

Because You never get all thermic energy out of  the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  unobjectionable).

Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industrythat nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it'smore important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the systemas cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.         Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but theyusually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of theway down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".         Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing whenthe water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.\t\t\t\t\tJohn Nagle\n",

That level of analog multiplexing shouldbe rather easy to accomplish.Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do withoutgenerating intermodulation.

When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the coolingtower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside airwill condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is thenreformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companiesare forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires theraw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attackby lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the propertyrather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will savepower companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.John Eaton!hp-vcd!johne\n",

Automatic setups are fine for simple,repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on morecomplex events where you need to understand how the scope isactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scopein \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent timebeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay tothe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual samplingrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture butbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHzsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose frontend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important forequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case reallyonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a singlesample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to getuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope forgeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage forlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capabilityof the scope.

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains inany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a referencepower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance whichshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohmsin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an acceptednotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance ofthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omittedreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notationsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.For power:  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )For amplitude  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except forthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notationconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.Common references for audio are:\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\t0 dBV = 1 volt\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned usingthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is alldone to whatever reference is reasonable for the applicationor moment.Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linearimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, thepower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be donewith the above two identities and ohm's law.-- --------------------------------------------------------------------       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)    Intergraph Corp.

      "\tFrom: ragee@vdoe386.vak12ed.edu (Randy Agee)Subject: Radar detector DETECTORS?Organization: Virginia's Public Education Network (Richmond)Lines: 50Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment orcontribution to:In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  Ifyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and willnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance ofthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was foran officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Manylaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RFfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the policeare writing citations right and left for people using radardetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he hadfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it wasthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at ornear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep mefrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when myspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radardetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (whichis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend toobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind onlyworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwaveenlightment may be necessary.So, the questions are -  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector  antenna?  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?==============================================================================Randy T. Agee - ARS WB4BZX       | At some point, you probably pondered The P.O.

If\tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\trules.\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or\t``CEC''.\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't\toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\tequivalent NEC publications.\tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\tthe province.Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical\tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\tfind one willing to supervise.\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,\tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,\tand will impress the inspector.\tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it\ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\tbecome very brittle.Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?\tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're \tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\twork well).\t\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't\tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\taccurate.\tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\tthat you'll gouge the conductors.\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\tor the insulation.\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\tthat has no cover plate).Subject: What is UL listing?\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily\tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just\tthat it probably won't kill you.\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\toccupancy permits issued.\tSubject: What is CSA approval?\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\trequired by law.\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\tclaim.\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\tcompanies.Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\t    Residential Wiring\t    by Jeff Markell,\t    Craftsman Books,\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.\t    Practical Electrical Wiring\t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National\t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70\t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan\t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.\t    Wiring Simplified\t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan\t    Park Publishing Co.\t\tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC\trevision.  Which is currently 1990.\tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\tquestions on the net ;-).\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\tthis.\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\tclaims.\tIn general, the process goes like this:\t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not\t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose\t\t  special conditions on you, require loading\t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to\t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\t\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.\tDo I have to upgrade?\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\tlow.\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...Subject: What does an electrical service look like?\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere. \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\tnormally carries no current.\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\tinspector.\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\twell.\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\tservice).Subject: What is a circuit?\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\tair conditioners.\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\tpermissible.]\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\talternative to GFCI protection.Subject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\ttogether in the panel.\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\tequipment itself won't cause a fire.\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\treplaced.\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\tpurpose.\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\tcan often cause severe damage.Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\tpenny\" trick.\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\tBreakers don't do this.\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\tif you need one.Subject: What size wire should I use?\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.\tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate\theat easily:\t\tGauge\t\tAmps\t\t14\t\t15\t\t12\t\t20\t\t10\t\t30\t\t8\t\t40\t\t6\t\t65\t\tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\ton the application and precise wire type.Subject: Where do these numbers come from?\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\truns.\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\twire.Subject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.Subject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\tused?\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the\twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically\tsecure.\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the\tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.\tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\tthe circuit.\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\tGFCI happy.\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\tlaundry appliances.\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no\tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.\tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without\ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will\thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to\tground...Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\tprong the terminating screw connects to.Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect\tfrom downstream outlets.Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\tfairly resistant to damage.\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\tsheath.\t\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\tbut this is technically illegal.]\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\tand CEC):\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\t      in the breach...]\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\t      similar finish.\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\t      than 1m (39\").\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\tthe insulation.\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\tsolid wall coverings.\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\twire.\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\twiring section.] \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that \tpurpose.\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\t \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US, \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.\tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes.\tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything\tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.\tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous,\tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)\tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC\tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\t\tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU\t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc.\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90\t\tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF\tService entrance\t\t\tRWU\t\t\t\t\t\tTWU\t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90\t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90\t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90\t[* NMWU not for service entrance]Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?\tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable\tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.Subject: Junction box positioning?\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\tget nasty.Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\tmounted between the joists.\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*\tlong)\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.\tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\tin later.]\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\tfor the sensor can vary.\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\tand have them come and check out the problem.\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\tthan 50 feet long.Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far\tmore current than it can continuously.\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\t       on BX cable.\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\tShould the test button work?\tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\tit, and promised to investigate.)Subject: How should I wire my shop?\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the\tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.\tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\twrong.\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you\tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe''\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\thave a different idea.\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.Subject: Underground Wiring\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\tyour specific situation.\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.Subject: Aluminum wiring\tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new\twiring.\tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even\tcause a fire.\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\tfor the following things:\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\t       up each connection.\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\t       be repaired.\t    \t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\t       you can rent the tool.\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\t    \t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\t       (not nicked) wire etc.    \tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\tYou can do this yourself too.Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?\tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\tHere's some hints on what to look for:\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\t\t  proper marking.\t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\t\t  a GFCI)\t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\t\t- Switched neutrals\t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\t\t   not properly terminated wiring)\t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-)\t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\t\t  ceiling\t\t- Backwrapped grounding wiresSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\t\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\tcolour as the hot wires.\tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.\tComments on K&T:\t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in\t\t  quite good condition.\t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between\t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\t\t  any circuit.\t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\t\t  that contain K&T.\t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\t\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't\tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\t\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\ttubing.\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.Subject: Where do I buy stuff?\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\tknow what you're talking about.

      "\tFrom: schmidt@auvax1.adelphi.eduSubject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiringLines: 163Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NYThere has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and groundingpractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, orthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, tocarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit thevoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  Itshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry thenormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters inthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the groundingconductor.  Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltageson the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the groundingconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used forthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and inmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should readboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications oninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulatedgrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductorsback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the serviceentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Manyof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not providea safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which isreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to bewhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground inmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrancepanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many householdservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  Inthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the groundingconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distancefrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small butmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Sincethere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipmenthas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does notpresent a shock hazard.  HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, youwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible insome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire ofinadequate size, causing it to overheat.With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which mayflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, whichincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, oftencausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path backto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fusesquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from thedwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of itflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may causecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in thewater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, notit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at anysub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in thisapplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to thegrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bondingscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperatewire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the daysbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want tohave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want tohave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in placeof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, thewires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,it's primarily for lightning protection.People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal groundingconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is.  Anywherethere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run underthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut thisaluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bondinglocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the emptysheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't havethe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance andinductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside thegreenfield.\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremoldbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold andthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiatorhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run aground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to thebox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outletswhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have theprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don'tinstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It isdesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungroundedGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might berenumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much moreto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Anyone else think so?Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they wereVERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggestproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outletswith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things youcan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers theywere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memoryperiodically.With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should beless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longerrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for theirequipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will findthat the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, itshould be o.k. for most applications.--- . SLMR 2.1 .

No.  No.  NOOO!!!The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in itunder normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop init either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even ifyou're grounded in some other way at the same time.  The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return forthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If youplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for thingslike sub-panels.)What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking andnews.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) andyou should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copyto you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here inthe future. \t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CAInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055\n",

May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this??  The ground issupposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggestlooks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire forpower and protection.  It'd never meet code, and if you now ownthe property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilitiesyou don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...There's a \"wiring\" FAQ that I think addresses this.  I believean alternative is use of a GFCI, but I'm really not sure whatcurrent code allows in this area.  The GFCI senses alternate(unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specificprotective ground wire, at least not beyond the GFCI in theprotected circuit.

If the ground connections on the outlets areconnected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to themain panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house groundrod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one ofthe goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hotto the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  Hmmm.

However, the best source of general information on building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the xstuff mail server.\tIn addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administrationincludes information on configuring and building X.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?\tApparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for allSun displays except for the cgsix.

Add \"-ldl\" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to surround it with \"-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic\" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIESvariable, since \"syslibs\" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile the stubs shared.)[thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), 12/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?\tIn SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflictswith the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to beundefined when building some X11 clients: \t_get_wmShellWidgetClass\t_get_applicationShellWidgetClassCompiling \"-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic\" appears to work. To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:Patch i.d.

The patch is on export in [1/93]\tcontrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC?I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentationfaults when running X.\tNote first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result inany performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the680x0 or VAX platforms.\tHere is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and the server.\tThis is from the GCC manual:\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \treference.\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for justthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags.  \tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \t\trgb/rgb.c\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args orreturn values:  \t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly harmless as they don't involve structs.[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do this simple test:\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\tSIOCGIFCONFRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gccsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  [courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \"missing\" defines for CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?\tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can addthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the Imakefile.  [11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1?The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.\tSun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line \t#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied from another distribution.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4?All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:\tld.so: libXmu.so.4: not foundor even:\tld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c\tIf you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you need to run \"ldconfig\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you'veinstalled X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; itattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic tomost C compilers).----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5libraries only applied to the documented interface).  A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis (jpf@heliocentric.com)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your systemadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) usedby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site.\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute pathsto the libraries.[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against thenewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suidprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhapsmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).[Thanks to Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca); 2/93.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 106)  What is Imake?\tImake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is amakefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process bywhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configurationfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not obvious.\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, andR5 versions are different.\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information onusing Imake to build X\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4guide to imake.\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by JimFulton on an early version of Imake\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.eduin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;mail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNuttin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make / I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing towrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in TheX Journal, issue 2:1.\t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article ondemystifying Imake.\t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with X11R5.\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imakewithout picking up the entire distribution.\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is inftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\tUndefined:\t_XShapeQueryExtension\t_XShapeCombineMask\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangularwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway.\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includeswill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you canprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X libraries.[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the error \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normallybe called.\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normalXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it calledXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and iscorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,although this will certainly solve the problem.\t[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); 11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under the current version of X, I get this message:\tUndefined:\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\t_XtTextReplace\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in additionto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions butare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.[10/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from onewindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask thewindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what arecalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, youcan use something like the following:        XWMHints wmhints;        ...        wmhints.flags = InputHint;        wmhints.input = True;        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't havesource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having this done. \tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resourceto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could bespoofed in any case. \tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking forparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to takeadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in orderto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;this surely leads to future compatibility problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\t\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Goodapplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just this one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point forquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 distributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget issensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\t{\tArg args[3];\tint i;\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\ti=0;\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\t...\t}But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; declaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if youuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.[11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code.They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for awidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, yourapplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets' data becoming corrupted.\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation ofthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that nosuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources forthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the locationin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics aredefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget.\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.----------------------------------------------------------------------David B.

The more specific youare, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Withoutall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they areable to respond at all.\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and whatyou expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?\tThe trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)are publishing more articles on X.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager.  Get it either:\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book\t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X ProtocolReference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the presentation.[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\". The complete document is on the R5tapes.\tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \"RTFM\" and isthe most-important of the least-read X documents.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further thedevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\tMIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specificationis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortiumas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4distribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOKwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif wasdeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF members. \tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in thestyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (includingthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; anda number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, dxpsview, etc.).(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)[8/90] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  15)  What is PEX?\tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\".\tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3D graphics.\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sampleimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for their workstations and X terminals.[last modified 10/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?There are several options for using X over serial lines:SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IPpackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-pointlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation thanSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wirestill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originallydeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a pseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \tconnected), and   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\thave to cross the serial interface, and   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \tblocks to compress.LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on astandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBXwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in R6.Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on howLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.eduin contrib/ in the following files:        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk atthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of theX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there isno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in are-parenting window manager. \tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offerssome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlapand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the StyleGuide functionality\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-inLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is onavahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\tpswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\tswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multipleGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comesfrom the resources file\ttwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworkedtwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with asingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is availableon archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available from export. [3/92]\ttvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twmand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It isavailable on archive servers\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta versionis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals \tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\tvuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\t4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\tIt needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager inthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconicor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming thegeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. Look for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.[10/90]\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-runningapplications and the resource database. [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.] ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?\tDEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The Xprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which isa capability not supported by all systems.\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may providecommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to beproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and does not do \"macro expansion.\"\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, accept a translation resource such as:\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locallywithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include controlcharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of thecontrol character you want to include.\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; norhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.----------------------------------------------------------------------David B.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget andthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of othercallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leavingdangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\t\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answeris set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code dropsout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\t{\t\tint             answer;\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\");\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\t\t\t{\t\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\");\t\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\t\t\t\texit(0);                }\t}\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it.\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop andwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to thecalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \"OK\", \"Cancel\" and \"Help\" or equivalents:  int AskUser(w, string)        Widget          w;        char           *string;  {        int             answer=RET_NONE;\t/* some not-used marker */        Widget          dialog;\t\t\t/* could cache&carry, but ...*/        Arg             args[3];        int             n = 0;        XtAppContext    context;        n=0;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);        XtManageChild(dialog);        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);        }        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */        return answer;  }\tThe dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices:  void response(w, client, call)        Widget          w;        XtPointer client;        XtPointer call;  {  int *answer = (int *) client;  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;        switch (reason->reason) {        case XmCR_OK:                *answer = RET_YES;\t/* some #define value */                break;        case XmCR_CANCEL:                *answer = RET_NO; \t\tbreak;        case XmCR_HELP:                *answer = RET_HELP;                break;        default:                return;        }}and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed andcontinues from there.[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contribWidgetWrap library. 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.\tUsers of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.\tIf you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want.

Using a window id of NULL (\"no window\") could create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can takethe following steps to avoid the error:1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab theimage from the pixmap.5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good.6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?\tA number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straightcharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it isrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:\t\tdisplay = XOpenDisplay(display_name);\tif (display)\t\t{ do X stuff }\telse\t\t{ do curses or something else }where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 128)  How do I make a \"busy cursor\" while my application is computing?Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?\tThe easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):     unsigned long valuemask;     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than32767.When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back tonormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouseevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may nothave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change thecursor without blocking pointer events.[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller (argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. \tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \t\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));to close the file-descriptor in the display information.

Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?\tNo. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leavethe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard pointsout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific toXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may becalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupthandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event whichhas previously been added.\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\tIt's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor.\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use onlynon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there isnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginningand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almostalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data:\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;Ollie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not settingthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widgetwhich should receive the event.\t If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that youavoid a round-trip to the server.\tDepending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to callits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.[courtesy Mark A.

However, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped:  while (!done)    {      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);      switch (the_event.type) {\tcase Expose:\t /* On expose events, redraw */\t\tXDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);\t\tbreak;\t...\t}    }\tNote that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code:  ...  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);  ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background.And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based programif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it maynot yet have appeared.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\tThe 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information aboutone of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection.\tThe macros which you can use to obtain information about the particularScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- onewhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\tIn Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\t(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macroswhich return characteristics of the Screen have \"Display\" in the names -- XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\t----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\tNote that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate thepixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

Note that there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\".\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparentwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your applicationwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colorsthat will appear properly.[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see alsoThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for thislast option]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on abackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawingoperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color thatthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visuallyrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Blackand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematicalcoincidence will break.]\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosenpre-computed values.\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley (whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\tMake sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black.

I want to check whetherthe window exists before doing anything with it.\tBecause X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent anevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send theevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme willwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window.[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?\tYes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, exceptfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of theapplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID intoit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it alsoknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the firstapplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentionedin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. \tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?\tA number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do nothandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root.

You have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can deferactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-clickbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the casein your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromisecheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, shouldbe the single-click action or the double-click action.[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 151)!

Xt Glossary----------------------------------------------------------------------o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the  Intrinsics are not especially useful.o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless  widgets or gadgets.o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib  functions because Xt provides most such services although an  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?----------------------------------------------------------------------In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion forcritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one ofthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all theappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of alist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out thatbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problemspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions otherfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed thatthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in theinterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by awork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add eitherof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerousto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectivelypreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will neverbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loopabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handlercan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because itis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operatingsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'ReillyVolume 6 are in error.----------------------------------------------------------------------4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?----------------------------------------------------------------------This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window hasthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap andborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmapresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questionsdeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of theseresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In theshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreenand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources isnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window iscreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values dependson the visual being used.  How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  Thefirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visualand the second is if you want a particular shell within an applicationto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easierbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is alittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkityourself in order to determine the needed information./* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>#include <X11/StringDefs.h>#include <X11/Shell.h>typedef struct{\tVisual\t*visual;\tint\tdepth;} OptionsRec;OptionsRec\tOptions;XtResource resources[] ={\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},};XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] ={\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}};intmain (argc, argv)\tint\t\targc;\tchar\t\t**argv;{\tXtAppContext\tapp;\t\t/* the application context */\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\t/* toplevel widget */\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\t\t/* display */\tchar\t\t**xargv;\t/* saved argument vector */\tint\t\txargc;\t\t/* saved argument count */\tColormap\tcolormap;\t/* created colormap */\tXVisualInfo\tvinfo;\t\t/* template for find visual */\tXVisualInfo\t*vinfo_list;\t/* returned list of visuals */\tint\t\tcount;\t\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\tArg\t\targs[10];\tCardinal\tcnt;\tchar\t\t*name = \"test\";\tchar\t\t*class = \"Test\";\t/*\t * save the command line arguments\t */\txargc = argc;\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\t/*\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\t */\tcnt = 0;\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\t\t\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\tcnt = 0;\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\t\t\t\t   XtNumber (resources),\t\t\t\t   args, cnt);\tcnt = 0;\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\t{\t\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\t\t/*\t\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there isno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has tobe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then yourapplication probably falls into the category of always using thedefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particularvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or somesuch).Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a serverallocates resources I may not always want your application to run inTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I maybe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColoror just monochrome.As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many differentpossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, staticcolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.----------------------------------------------------------------------6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrarywidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for theshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of thatshell.A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must haveits own realize method to use the visual when it callsXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can beobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  Areasonable value is probably XtNvisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?----------------------------------------------------------------------The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  Thisis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copiescolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as thevisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?----------------------------------------------------------------------Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This wasespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.----------------------------------------------------------------------9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  TheIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and allof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way anypending X events or further references to that widget can be cleanedup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is thenperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions havecompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point thelist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, amongother things.As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if theIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to thewidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occursimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed onthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are notdestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.----------------------------------------------------------------------10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?----------------------------------------------------------------------The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exitingan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widgetmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as opensockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code forsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\tWidget\tToplevelGet (gw)\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\t\t\t/* empty */;\t\treturn (top);\t}\tvoid\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\t\texit (0);\t}One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroyingthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may neveroccur.  This works for most widgets and most applications but will not workfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think thatsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of thereason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorantof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that thewidget may change and someday require that some external state iscleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag andthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, privateevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, anddifficult to maintain practices.Try the following code instead.\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\t\tWidget\t\tgw\t#endif\t);\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\t#endif\t);\textern void ExitCallback (\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\t#endif\t);\tWidget\tToplevelGet (gw)\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\t\t\t/* empty */;\t\treturn (top);\t}\tvoid\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\t{\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\t}\tBoolean\tExitWorkProc (closure)\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t{\t\texit (0);\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\t}ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when theapplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events areprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.----------------------------------------------------------------------11. How do I resize a Shell widget?----------------------------------------------------------------------After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The properthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widgetusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to theShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow therequest.  However, the Shell must have the resourceXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask thewindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, notthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.----------------------------------------------------------------------12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?----------------------------------------------------------------------It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file doesnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a filedescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would notblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not toblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  Fora file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics alwayscalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about tobe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV basedOS's it is the poll() system call.How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to useanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipeto connect the application with this other process and pass the filedescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program onBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_reliable.  In particular:\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\t  been given the whole block).Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such asread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area andmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designersfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included withpart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at thispoint I don't know.----------------------------------------------------------------------13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?----------------------------------------------------------------------I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspectiveit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the fulldetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was alreadyfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or maynot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, whichmeans its a 1000 pages.Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\tDirect at 1-800-DIGITAL.The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:Young, Doug. \"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\tXt (Motif Version),\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\t(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xtreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensivelyoverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding itvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references toother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down relatedinformation.I read two periodicals, \"The X Resource\" and the \"The X Journal\".These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \"The X Resource\"is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being theMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is noadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  Fororders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorialmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted atmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\"The X Journal\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technicalaudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with anexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent afairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty goodcollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call(908) 563-9033.----------------------------------------------------------------------14. What Widgets are available?----------------------------------------------------------------------There are three popular widget sets:Athena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.Motif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\t  it is poorly implemented.OLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:Xtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\t  them so I can't comment.FWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.Xcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\t  widely used.Xs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.Xw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.Xo\t- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*The following specialized widgets are also available:Tbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.Plots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.----------------------------------------------------------------------15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?----------------------------------------------------------------------\t__________________________________________\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\t__________________________________________\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\t__________________________________________However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing andimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will developin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keepyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a languageother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.----------------------------------------------------------------------16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\ttypdef struct\t{\t\t    String\tname;\t    long\tvalue;\t} Arg;and the code:\tArg\targ;\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)expands to\tArg\targ;\targ.name = \"name\";\targ.value = 3.2;you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.valuegets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  Whenthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern iswildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,how to get around this?The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am nowrecomending it over the previous suggestions.#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\    } else { \\        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\    }----------------------------------------------------------------------17. How do I write a resource converter?----------------------------------------------------------------------Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allowfor destructors and caching of converted values.There are several main types of resource converters:    string to data type    data type to string    data type to data typei) string to data type    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\tName\t\tValue\t\"True\"\t\t1\t\"False\"\t\t0    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one    of the converters.ii) data type to string    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,    probably by the use of sprintf.    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure    that they are consistent.iii) data type to data type    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for    red, green and blue.The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);    Display *dpy;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;    XrmValuePtr fromVal;    XrmValuePtr toVal;    XtPointer *converter_data;When the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the sourceX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to thedestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argumentis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specifiedwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" argumentsallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it isinvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussedabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup thePixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.Care must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has thefollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for aconverted value:typedef struct {    unsigned int    size;    caddr_t         addr;} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location ofthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of thedestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  Ifthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter shouldset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  Thecaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke theconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simplycopy the converted value into the space given and return True.If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location tothe address of a static variable containing the converted value andreturn True.When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and itbecomes convenient to define a macro:    #define DONE(var, type) \\      if (toVal->addr) \\\t{ \\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\t    { \\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\t      return False; \\\t    } \\\t  else \\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\t} \\      else \\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\      return True;    #define DONESTR(str) \\      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\t{ \\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\t  return False; \\\t} \\      else \\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\      return True;Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safetychecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that yourconverter is being called properly.Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with theIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creatingwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.To register a converter with a single application context, useXtAppSetTypeConverter:void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\tcache, destructor)    XtAppContext context;    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;To register a converter with all application contexts, useXtSetTypeConverter:void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\tcache, destructor)    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter andXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverterand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should beused.When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argumentspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basisCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is agood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).The \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then theresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count hasbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value isbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);    XtAppContext context;    XrmValuePtr to;    XtPointer converter_data;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associatedwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointedto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passedthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when theconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual argumentsfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need tofree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the privatedata passed in when the converter was registered.Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MITR5 distribution:    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h----------------------------------------------------------------------18. How do I open multiple displays?----------------------------------------------------------------------See \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issuesinvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In anutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each displayand remove it from the application context.The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This canhappen 3 ways:\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ aproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing thatdisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on theOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficultproblem.The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/Oerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially truefor a single display X based application, but not true for amultiple display program or an application that does things other thandisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs theI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoidreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragmentdemonstrates this:#include <setjmp.h>jmp_buf XIOrecover;voidXIOHandler (dpy)\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;{\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);}main (){\t...\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);}The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can goback to the application specific data and perform any necessarycleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() isfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in thejmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program tothe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return valueof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument tolongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for thispurpose it is adequate.Some other problems you might run into are resource converters thatimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errorssuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with thetotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limitednumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typicalvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying toconnect to a display.There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic inNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basicallysaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.----------------------------------------------------------------------19.

Where are the resources loaded from?----------------------------------------------------------------------The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places(from highest priority to lowest priority):\t1. Args passed at creation time.\t2. Command line arguments.\t3. User's per host defaults file\t4. User's defaults file.\t5. User's per application default file.\t6. System wide per application default file.Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The resultof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.The per host defaults file contains customizations for allapplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is eitherspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is notset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGERproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set thenthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" isused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that thisshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to thedisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte isreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGERbut most do not.A user may have many per application default files containingcustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quiteflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describesthe various environment variables and how they effect where this fileis found.The system wide per application default files are typically found in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then thefallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on howthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the variousenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]You can use several environment variables to control how resources areloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variablescontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as anapplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults filefrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the pathdefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such away that app-defaults files appear in several different directoryhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's OpenWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this forXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults filesin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever yourOPENWINHOME is located):\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%NThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list ofpathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows(see XtResolvePathname()):\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\t\tapplication's class name.\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language stringLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/MytermAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the aboveapp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, itreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect ofthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.Let's consider another example. This time, let's setXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the currentworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%NThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expandsto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting fordebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming theapp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, soyou can run the application from the directory in which you areworking and still have the resources loaded properly.NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is      defined so %T and %S are useless.With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customizationresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" applicationlike this:\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"If one of your pathname specifications had the value\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitutioncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in thisbatch of default settings.)The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%N:<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directoryif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to somevalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application findyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to setXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery workeddifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIRvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.----------------------------------------------------------------------21. What order are callbacks executed in?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is becauseboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability tomodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither onecurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannotguarantee the order of execution.The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; thewidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add andremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;therefore the functionality contained in a callback should beindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on thelist.Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallbacksays: \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the \tprocedure is to be appended.\" you may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routinesare called in the same order as they have been added to the callbacklist.----------------------------------------------------------------------22. How do I know if a widget is visible?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag> stays set to TRUE.Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of theprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, inthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this sectioncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes fromviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something> else which needs to be done?You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest> way to determine if a window is iconified? As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an actionroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widgetwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see themap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These aresuggestions.----------------------------------------------------------------------23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------You can't.----------------------------------------------------------------------24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?----------------------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it ishandled something like:\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\tif (!ptr)\t{\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\t\texit (1)\t}To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functionsXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() whichall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() andrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xterror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it usesXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\tif (!ptr)\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\telse\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\t++count;to be written as:\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I'vefound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'mallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions soI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating astructure or copying a string:\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\t  char\t     *ptr;\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow animplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable withmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\t char\t      *ptr;\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\t /* ... */\t free (ptr);may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did thisbroken and complain to the vendor.A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a stringwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().----------------------------------------------------------------------25. How to debug an Xt application?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is agreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit priceyat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb(contact support@pure.com for more info).\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs onmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL DebuggingEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C libraryfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.comfor more info)Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run insynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command lineargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Thenset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to theoriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronousmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls toXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from theserver are asynchronous.Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use theundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.For example:    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &    example% xwininfo -tree\t     <click in new xload window>will give the normal information but the widget name and class of eachwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and sizeof errant widgets.Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want totest the way a widget manages it's children, you can tryexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filterbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviourof both.  It's a very clever idea.The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while theapplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as froma pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need togo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The serverlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one elsecan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stoppedwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going toyour application which is stopped.The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines onyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)on one machine, and running the application on the other, possiblyusing a command sequence like this:\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\tor this:\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\tthismachine% gdb application\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\t(gdb) run ...I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a methodof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions torelease any grabs during breakpoints.Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills andknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowingthe internals of a particular widget but not very far withoutunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditionalbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a greatdeal.----------------------------------------------------------------------26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?----------------------------------------------------------------------   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted thoseroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens isthey use a default application context different then the one you mayhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a perapplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,you won't get those events.For example:\t...\tcnt = 0;\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\tXtAppMainLoop (app)would never invoke the timeout.----------------------------------------------------------------------27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an``intuitive'' fashion.Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook hassupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable witheach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible publicprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  Myintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people tosupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they developand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as longas it is based on Xt).The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCMconventions, for more details read the code.I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel thatit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem tobe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motifanyway.The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp fromnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

For example, incorrectEnglish constructs such as \"its raining\" or \"it's window id\" annoy me.However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the waythings really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWSwas really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technicallysuperior as well!).On a related topic, who is to say that \"color\" is more or less correctthan \"colour\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposedto American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for APIterms such as \"XAllocColor\" and \"colormap\".In a world that uses the term \"Windows\" to refer to Microsoft Windows,perhaps the time has come to accept \"X Windows\" as a valid term for X.I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,\"the X Window System\" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literatepeople. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,snappy, descriptive title (\"X\" is positively obscure) will helpwhen dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was asoftware engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not becomepopularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it shouldbe called \"Microsoft Windows\" or \"the Microsoft Window System\" orhow about just plain \"Microsoft\"!To summarise (or should that be \"summarize\") the point of this message:I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community thanworrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system(or should that be \"windowing system\"). Whatever gets recognised isfine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting whattrade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to thisconclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.\t\t\tGerard O'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk)\t\t\tDu Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.\n",

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire currentdisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has anundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]is the most recent.\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpris available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is availablefrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2psand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z andcontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archiveservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, andsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\tAlso: \tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.netin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers.\tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) include session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portionof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, aversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on it, and save it in one of the available formats.

If you give a resource specification like this:\t\txterm*geometry: 80x24then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small.

However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for manipulating the selection will help; e.g. \t% xselection PRIMARY | lprfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting ofthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can beadapted to do this.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at mostone app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another fromthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever yourOPENWINHOME is located):\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%NThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                application's class name.        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the                literal string \"app-defaults\"        %C      customization resource (R5 only)        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")        %t      The territory part of the display's language string        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the applicationfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loadedproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and%S are useless.\tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot inthis batch of default settings.)\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\t\t<root>/%N:\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run aprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdbwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\t#!/bin/sh\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

It includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, andxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\t\teval `xrlogind`where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X Journal for more information.\tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font formatand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; aversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produceBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts.

(You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in the path.)\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, orthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (Themention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find   it, run bldfamily(1).)-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work   for X11Rn.[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  40)  How do I convert a \".snf\" font back to \".bdf\" font?\tA tool called \"snftobdf 1.4\" is part of the bdftools package, which is available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.

How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)I want to be able to do something like this:\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets, however.[courtesy Chris D.

If you received the R5 source distribution directly from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look inmit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.][Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  52)  Why do I get \"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\"?\tThis error, which typically goes on to say, \"widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003\" indicates that the header files you included when building your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.\tHowever, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OWsystems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings youhave seen.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?\tWebster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster'sDictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became awarethat these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.\t[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. AWebster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in \"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\".]\tUnless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a sitewhich can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. \tHowever, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up thelatest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and non-availability of dictionary servers. \t[courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels Mayer) 11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?\tNo. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not \"public domain\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.\tContributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain byindividual authors.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject:  57)!

All this doesn't influence Motif,which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkitis IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized andfeatures alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.You cannot say \"A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer\" ONLY because they have thewheel and the gear at the same position.

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:  \tBinary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize \tbinaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have \tbin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...  \tMulti-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac  \tand Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which  \thas gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in  \t80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. \tNote NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.  \tBuilt-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton  \tor DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform  \tor display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. \tso I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on   \tmy PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.  \tConfigurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS \tor NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.  \tObject oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have \tto re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch \tor my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.  In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean kernel so you can actually understand it.

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda. Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.  They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory, and some stuff about comms.     The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and  X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.  The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course.  Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMackem Ian. \n",

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]  The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data. Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad \n",

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not, by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience), and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as mentioned before, the \"socialistic masses\" that were bent on destroying  _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers  \tAlthough we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not \telectricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If \tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't \tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician, \tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke; \tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.  \tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National \tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC). \tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail \twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections \tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong, \twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!  \tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the \tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others, \thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building \tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in \tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also, \tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements \tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that \twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family \tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial \testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different \trules.  \tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in \tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary \tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada. \tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line \tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number \tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've \tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or \t``CEC''.  \tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often \tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the \tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group. \tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released. \tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly \tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the \tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged \tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. \tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized \tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the \trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for \tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive -- \tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up \tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance \tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. \tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two \tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments, \tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book. \tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified \tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA \tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the \tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is \tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th \tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th \tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an \tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.  \tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical \tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In \tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't \toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I \thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the \tequivalent NEC publications.  \tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout \tthe province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?  \tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. \tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical \tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's \thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do \twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) \tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However, \tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial \twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can \tfind one willing to supervise.  \tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:  \tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better \tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home, \tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make \ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills \tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. \tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that \tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, \tand will impress the inspector.  \tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to \tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your \ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners. \tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely \tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.  \tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.  \tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip \twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector \twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it \ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of \t12ga wire through your hand that way.  \tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C \tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types \tbecome very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?  \tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few \tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're  \tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved \tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers \t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.  \tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or \t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or \tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill \t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and \t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull \tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even \tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.  \tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you \tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws \twork well). \t \tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or \tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper, \tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay \t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized \tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should \tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the \tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There \tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't \tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.  \tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends \tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.  \tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.  \tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling \tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire \tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more \taccurate.  \tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for \tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the \tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, \tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a \t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip \tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to \tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley \tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) \tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility \tthat you'll gouge the conductors.  \tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well \tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18). \tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire \tor the insulation.  \tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired \toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more \texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple \tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated \twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost \tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.  \tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are \tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) \tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is \tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known \tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)  \tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. \tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or \ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.  \tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent \twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for \twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap  \taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination \tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to \tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet \tthat has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?  \tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be \tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent \tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment \tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means \tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements \tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily \tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just \tthat it probably won't kill you.  \tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are \tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However, \tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will \tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to \tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in \tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component \tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose. \tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring \tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or \toccupancy permits issued. \t Subject: What is CSA approval?  \tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the \tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in \tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done \twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to \tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is \trequired by law.  \tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved \tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the \tclaim.  \tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC \t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to \tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance \tcompanies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?  \tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers  \t    Residential Wiring \t    by Jeff Markell, \t    Craftsman Books, \t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.  \t    Practical Electrical Wiring \t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National \t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70 \t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan \t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.  \t    Wiring Simplified \t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan \t    Park Publishing Co. \t \tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC \trevision.  Which is currently 1990.  \tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called \t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version \tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the \tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring, \tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get \tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer \tquestions on the net ;-).  \tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is \tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?  \tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and \tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more \tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not \tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections \tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors \tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose \ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.  \tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your \thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a \tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about \tthis.  \tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at \tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage \tclaims.  \tIn general, the process goes like this: \t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building \t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or \t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is \t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not \t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose \t\t  special conditions on you, require loading \t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point \t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need. \t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to \t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected \t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection. \t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority \t\t  rather than the usual inspectors. \t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before \t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a \t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection. \t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, \t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. \tDo I have to upgrade?  \tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, \tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some \tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the \tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you \tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all \tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240  \tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the \tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of \ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V \tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same \tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required \tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. \tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there \tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not \tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped \tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially \tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number \tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, \tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers. \tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and \t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will \tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.  \tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable \tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V \tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device \tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that \tlow.  \t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between \tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any \thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\" \tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.  \tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended \tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?  \tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the \tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility \tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.   \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes  \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where \tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic \taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)). \tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that \tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire \tnormally carries no current.  \tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or \tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire. \tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the \tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It \tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often \tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected \tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.  \tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in \ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode. \tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral \tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional \tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house \twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.  \tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually \tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are \tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one \tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations  \t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do \thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your \tinspector.  \tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\" \twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as \twell.  \tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each \tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires, \tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the \twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.  \tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. \tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected \ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one \twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some \trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only \tservice).  Subject: What is a circuit?  \tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. \tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected \tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations: \t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit. \t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit. \t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral, \t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.  \t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and \tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying \tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they \toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several \tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is \tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or \tair conditioners.  \t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar \tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there \tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral \tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing \tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead \tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. \tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles \tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but \tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC, \tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to \tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is \tpermissible.]  \t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, \twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.  \t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a \tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.  \tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground \twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC \trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends \tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail \tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.  \tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the \tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.  \tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) \tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places \trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\", \tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an \talternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".  \tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the \t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green \tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when \tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white \twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the \tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the \tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding \tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should \tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire \tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected \ttogether in the panel.  \t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground \tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]  \tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used \tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to \tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\" \ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light \tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?  \tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power \tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For \texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should \t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As \tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the \twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the \tequipment itself won't cause a fire.  \tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt \t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby \tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively \tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have \tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use \ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid \ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a \tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be \treplaced.  \tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They \tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched \tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow \tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip \theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the \tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave \tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to \ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high \toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite \tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown \twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which \tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in \tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the \tpurpose.  \tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead \tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even \tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which \tcan often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?  \tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher \trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually \tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts \tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse \tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a \tpenny\" trick.  \tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better \tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.  \tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When \ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting \tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, \tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical \tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down. \tBreakers don't do this.  \tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit \tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new \tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special \tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)  \tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse \tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse \tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the \tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently \tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you \tif you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?  \tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit, \tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run, \tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid \tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than \t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.  \tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for \tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or \tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate \theat easily:  \t\tGauge\t\tAmps \t\t14\t\t15 \t\t12\t\t20 \t\t10\t\t30 \t\t8\t\t40 \t\t6\t\t65 \t \tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent \ton the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?  \tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. \tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When \tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is \tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need \thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in \tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long \truns.  \tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances. \tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller \twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most \tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits \tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger \twire.  Subject: What does \"14-2\" mean?  \tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors \tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second \tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but \tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means \t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.  \t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes \tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In \tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.  \t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. \tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they \tused?  \tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used \tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\" \tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.  \tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them \ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.  \tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the \twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically \tsecure.  \tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check \tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the \tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.  \tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or \tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers, \tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes \tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it \tgoes in the wirenut properly.  \tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical \ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may \ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because \ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead \tof taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?  \tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures \tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the \tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the \tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other \tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of \tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any \tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking \tthe circuit.  \tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If, \tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral \tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI \twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot \tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the \tGFCI happy.  \tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric. \tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed \t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be \tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices \tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be \tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?  \tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase \toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, \tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or \tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water \tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, \tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', \ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and \tlaundry appliances.  \tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there \tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or \tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you \thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to \toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.  \tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may \twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI \tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI \toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in \tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your \tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children? \tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does \twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?  \tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a \tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run \tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers, \tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs \tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that \tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary \tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most \tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no \tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring \tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?  \tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the \tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with \ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI \tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE \tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one \tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch \tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), \tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a \tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive; \tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on \twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such \ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.  \tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use \tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use \tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.  \tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one \tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't \treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first \toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet \tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But \tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.  \tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little \t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark \tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which \toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the \ttest button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?  \tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, \tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without \ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against \tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of \tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an \tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the \tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly \ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not \tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if \tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of \tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very \ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace \tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).  \tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In \tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with \texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating \telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will \thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; \tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were \tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to \tground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization  \tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the \tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) \ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. \tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the \tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to \thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).  \tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.  \tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right \tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the \tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the \thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. \tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which \tprong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?  \tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance \tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex \treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more \tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider \tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet. \tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except \tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits \tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, \tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be \tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).  \tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab \tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to \tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. \tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When \t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be \tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral \tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect \tfrom downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?  \tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to \tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in \tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?  \tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. \tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM. \tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside \tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject \tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are \twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several \tdifferent categories of NM cable.  \tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a \tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is \tfairly resistant to damage.  \tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic \tsheath. \t \tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable \tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer \tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC) \tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected \tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of \tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.  \t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored \tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, \tbut this is technically illegal.]  \tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the \tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague \treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC \tand CEC):  \t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage \t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls \t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. \t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. \t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces \t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian \t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet \t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable \t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance. \t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. \t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating \t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by \t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation \t      material (a wad of fiberglass). \t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box \t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. \t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\". \t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to \t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation, \t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical] \t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge. \t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring \t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured \t      in the breach...] \t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or \t      similar finish. \t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. \t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists \t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more \t      than 1m (39\").  \tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small \tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to \tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through \tthe insulation.  \tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by \tsolid wall coverings.  \tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of \ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a \tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of \tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the \twire.  \tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.  \tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will \tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like \tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of \tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground \twiring section.]   \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be  \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  \tpurpose.  \tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through \tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed \tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this \tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses \tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building. \tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. \t  \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,  \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the  \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\". \tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.  \tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes \tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. \tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes. \tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything \tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.  \tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous, \tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)  \tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC  \tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90 \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t \tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc. \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90 \t \tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF \tService entrance\t\t\tRWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTWU \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90 \t[* NMWU not for service entrance]  Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?  \tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable \tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box \titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic \tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.  \tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable \tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still \tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also \trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.  \tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for \tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground \tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other \thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For \texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?  \tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.  \tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible \tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction \tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may \tget nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?  \tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few \tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage \trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half \ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire \tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle \tconstraints as well.  For example, older house \twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess \theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the \tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. \tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high \ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your \tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case \treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)  \tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some \tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and \tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy \tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box \tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling \tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available \tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and \tmounted between the joists.  \tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as \t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated \tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. \tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated \tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually \t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering \twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet* \tlong)  \tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\" \tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. \tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, \twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. \tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't \tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector \trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get \taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown \tin later.]  \tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and \tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are \tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat \tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should \tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses. \tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location \tfor the sensor can vary.  \tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved \tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?  \tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is \tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up \tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with \trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can \tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in \tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions \trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).  \tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately \tand have them come and check out the problem.  \tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with \tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A \tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness \tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?  \tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of \tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors \tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque, \tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.  \tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows \t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between \tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal \t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the \ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.  \tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually \tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you \twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to \tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is \tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have \ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a \t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if \tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to \treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an \tarticle on how to do this if you must.  \tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using \tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?  \tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there \tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply \twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times \tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also \tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor \twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the \tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.  \tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more \tthan 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?  \tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 \twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, \tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 \twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, \tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational \tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.  \tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router \tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far \tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall \thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when \tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. \tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that \tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker \twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far \tmore current than it can continuously.  \tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This \tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure, \tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?  \tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead \tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety \tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither \tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.  \tThere are several different approaches to solving this: \t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the \t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect \t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle \t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise. \t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and \t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can \t       run a conductor to it from the third prong. \t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel. \t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug \t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI \t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI \t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong \t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets, \t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it \t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault \t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected \t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't \t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath \t       on BX cable.  \tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three \tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop. \tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets? \tShould the test button work?  \tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though, \tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's \ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE \tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current \tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI. \tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require \ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press \tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again: \tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially \tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.  \tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground \twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The \tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the \tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never \ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand, \tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device \tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded \toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are \tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician \twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require \tit, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?  \tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all \tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies \tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the \tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for \tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or \tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have \tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp \tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles \twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights \tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared \twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two \tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a \tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand \tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.  \tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the \tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. \tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each \tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same \ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and \tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have \tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit \twrong.  \tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\" \trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used \tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be \trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.  \tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V \tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. \tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you \tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled \textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of \tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much \theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)  \tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, \tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop \twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to \tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. \tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' \tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. \tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to \thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy \t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.  \tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished \tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And \teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop \toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might \thave a different idea.  \tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop \twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring  \tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use \tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic \ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots \tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion \tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is \tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically \tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, \tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion \tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And \tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.  \tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to \tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about \tyour specific situation.  \tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power \tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring  \tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became \tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time, \taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, \tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. \tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new \twiring.  \tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum \twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. \tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper \tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential \tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.  \tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as \t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When \tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes \tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each \ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes \twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance \tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ \toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot, \tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even \tcause a fire.  \tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move \tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of \tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing \ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you \thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring \tfor the following things:  \t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to \t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will \t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes \t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat \t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.  \t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around \t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be \t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the \t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug \t       up each connection.  \t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the \t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.  \t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. \t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with \t       the proper screw connections immediately.  \t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, \t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should \t       be repaired. \t     \t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be \t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the \t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting \t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be \t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an \t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter \t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless \t       you can rent the tool.  \t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring \t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above. \t     \t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped \t       (not nicked) wire etc.      \tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring \tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider \tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places, \twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used, \tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having \tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. \tYou can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?  \tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire \tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. \tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an \tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor \tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any \tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many \tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.  \tHere's some hints on what to look for:  \tObvious non-code wiring can include:  \t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls \t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without \t\t  proper marking. \t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of \t\t  a GFCI) \t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) \t\t- Switched neutrals \t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines  \tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one \ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:  \t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps \t\t   not properly terminated wiring) \t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are \t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when \t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-) \t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations \t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps \t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them \t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or \t\t  ceiling \t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring \t \tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different \twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you \tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old  \tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.  \tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called \t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with \ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural \tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). \tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections \twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping \twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately, \tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs \tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture. \tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some \tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same \tcolour as the hot wires.  \tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.  \tComments on K&T:  \t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about \t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. \t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up \t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in \t\t  quite good condition. \t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install. \t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with \t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either, \t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. \t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between \t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to \t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on \t\t  any circuit. \t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls \t\t  that contain K&T. \t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be \t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector. \t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more \t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did. \t \tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't \tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should \twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and \tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly \treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on \tnew circuits using modern techniques. \t \tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type \tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks \tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was \tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor. \tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback \tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole \tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at \ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.  \tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if \tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as \tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. \tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several \thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink \ttubing.  \tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. \tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky. \tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard \tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be \treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff - \tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?  \tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their \tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or \tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety \tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that \tknow what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable \tsales people.  They'll give you much valuable information. --  Chris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541 Psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca Ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca \n",

Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine Distribution: na Lines: 18  Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a \"boxer\" type fan by installing a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

Raw HC11 parts have factory set ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.  Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing the EPROM array to light.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

Has anyone out there had some experience in doing this?  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but I thought that I had it worked out.  However, with a 32kHz crystal the lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting to create.  I have done the following things:  1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is    low during this time.   2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or    WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks very much,  Martin. \n",

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code.

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT (not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a \"dag\" as well as the outer coating.

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.  When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc., it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.

The ability to program was >an entry requirement.  At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming)  start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000  assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and  Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company  for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special  Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).   The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering  (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing  Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly).   In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a  30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework  assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?  BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.  \tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.  \tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote  doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary  (just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?  \tThe trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.) are publishing more articles on X.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)  \tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the  official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It  describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with  other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need  to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the  selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window  manager.  Get it either: \t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT \t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book \t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X Protocol Reference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete. \tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to  the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the  presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]  \t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's \"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\". The complete document is on the R5 tapes.  \tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \"RTFM\" and is the most-important of the least-read X documents.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?  \tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of  cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software  interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment. \tMIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations). \tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. \tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed. \tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer  Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.

OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.   \tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's  (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.  \tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.

[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?  \tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI  toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  15)  What is PEX?  \tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\". \tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics. \tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?  There are several options for using X over serial lines:  SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:    (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't  \totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly  \tconnected), and    (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that \thave to cross the serial interface, and    (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering  \tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for  \tblocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following files:         XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]  \tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?  \tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):  \twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3 \tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed,  although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape. \ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.  \tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers \tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system.  \trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size. \tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering \thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm \tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit \ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering  \tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality \tolwm (AT&T): ditto \tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93] \tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape \tpswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release \tswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes from the resources file \ttwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape \tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available  from export. [3/92] \ttvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is available on archive servers \tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is  available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export. \tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92]. \tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look  \tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals  \tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5  twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. \tvuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces. \t4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM \tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?  \tIt needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like: \t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?  \tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] \tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.  [Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?  \tDEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this,  add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname: \tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?  \tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems. \tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?  \tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do \"macro expansion.\" \tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such as: \txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\ \t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\") which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. \tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special \"remapper\" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)                  -------------------------> 1              |                       |              |                       |       |\\            -----   cathode 1         |       |  \\            XXXXX                     ________| +  \\            XXXXX|                            |      \\        -------     light >XXXXX|                            |        \\_____ divider __ output            XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------            XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |            XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2            XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /            XXXXX|         \\ /        |       |/            XXXXX| anode              |            XXXXX                     |            ----- cathode 2           |              |                       |              |                       |              --------------------------> 2  If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of \"tuning\" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between the two is the position of the LED.  Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ...   Lindholm, L.E., and K.E.

Marsolais, \"Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure- ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report\", Bull. Pros- thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.  Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate measurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanning a quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.              - David    +------------------------------------------------------------+ |  David Prutchi                 HC1DT                       | |  Washington University         <prutchi@mesun4.wustl.edu>  | |  Campus Box 1185               <dp@cec1.wustl.edu>         | |  One Brookings Drive                                       | |  St. Louis, MO  63130-4899                                 | +------------------------------------------------------------+ \n",

Where can I get a WYSIWYG interface builder?  \tA new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works  with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:   This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user   interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates   \"Wc - Widget Creation\" resource files and this distribution also includes the   Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and   Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth. Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  \tThe InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder  called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete  with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps  on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175). \tQuest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an interactive building tool.   \tDruid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC  machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but  apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for  which it generates C/UIL code.

I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation faults when running X.  \tNote first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms.  \tHere is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing  structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when  gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or  return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and  the server.  \tThis is from the GCC manual:  \tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for  \tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument \tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by  \treference.  \tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet \tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.  \tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and \t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.    \tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include: \t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c  \t\trgb/rgb.c  \tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or return values:   \t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c  \t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c.  Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly  harmless as they don't involve structs.

When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error  \t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket.  \tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"  \tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do  this simple test:  \t#include <sys/ioctl.h> \tSIOCGIFCONF  Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of  interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like  whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your  fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are  identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make  sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

What should these be?  \tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:         #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)         #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN         #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN  \tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so  references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the  Imakefile.

All of the executables that I try to run have the following results: \tld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found or even: \tld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c  \tIf you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you  need to run \"ldconfig\" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium] \tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site. \t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic). \t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?  \tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display.

Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable. \tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious. \tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and R5 versions are different.  \tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources: \t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X \t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information \t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4 guide to imake. \t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake \t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful  explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and  config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby.  [7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email; mail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu. \t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert. \t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make  / I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX  Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The X Journal, issue 2:1. \t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on demystifying Imake. \t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in  sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.  [1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?  \tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier  version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits  redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the  template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such  configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the  templates distributed with X11R5. \texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution. \tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?  \tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a  script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a  Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make,  which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines? When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error: \tUndefined: \t_XShapeQueryExtension \t_XShapeCombineMask  \tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.  \tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be  compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.

Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun? When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".  \tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.  \tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.  \t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in. \t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.   \tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem. \t [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be);  11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X? I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this message: \tUndefined: \t_XtScrollBarSetThumb \t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint \t_XtTextReplace  \tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?  \tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the following:          XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.  Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.   \tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant. \tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true  [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?  \tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.  \tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available? \t \tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just  this one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]  \tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?  \tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this: \t{ \tArg args[3]; \tint i; \tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */ \ti=0; \tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++; \tXtGetValues(widget, args, i ); \t... \t}  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page. [11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?  \tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. \tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets' data becoming corrupted. \t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?  \tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget.  \tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for \"cheap\", but I cannot get the source for \"cheap\", hence I am limited to using whatever X libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not seen it myself).    Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5 libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same problem when X11R6 becomes available.    The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif, but that sort of ruins the whole idea of \"free\", doesn't it?

How do I make a screendump or print my application?  \tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command: \t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]  \tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent. \txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z. \tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information:  soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu. \txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.  \tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.  \tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.  \tAlso:   \tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.  \tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers.  \tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion of screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.  \tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?  \tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can  \t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv  \t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?  \tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?  \tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z. \tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).  \tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.  \txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley),  can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity,  contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on  it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92;  see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  \tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z,  and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.  \tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.  \tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,  weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.  \tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.  \tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from  export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.  \txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.  \tA version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package  also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget.

The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.  [last updated 10/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?  \tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to  \"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as  \tXTerm*font: \t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 \tXTerm*boldfont:\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1 [The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]  In addition, you may want to set this in your shell: \tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1          For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with  the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using `man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (')  is Alt-'.

If you give  a resource specification like this: \t\txterm*geometry: 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly: \t\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?  \tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.  \t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export. \tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be adapted to do this.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?  \tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  \tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): \tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N  The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):          %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 application's class name.         %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the                 literal string \"app-defaults\"         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")         %t      The territory part of the display's language string         %c      The codeset part of the display's language string  \tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is  \"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.) \t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm \t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  \tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  \tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. \tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N  \tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.  \tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this: \tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"  \tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value \"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be \"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource.  \tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is: \t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5) \t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5) \t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5) \t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\ \t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\ \t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  \t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.)  \tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is  \t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5) \t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5) \t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5) \t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\ \t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\ \t\t<root>/%N:  \t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  \tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed  by a slash.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?  The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources; for example,  your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line  \tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false  to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also  \tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of: \t#!/bin/sh \t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources \t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap \t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $* Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\".  \tIf this doesn't work, also try starting off with: \t\t#!/bin/sh \t\t# Reset path: \t\tPATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?  \tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\" whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X. \tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar. \tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain \t\teval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90]  \tIn addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find \t\trsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information. \tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor. \tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers. \tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in export:/contrib.  \tIf you are a MetaFont user you can use \"mftobdf\" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu. \tThe GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe, a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats. \tThe O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font. \tFonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?  \tAfter you have built the font using your system's font-compiler,  installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent (e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp  $dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the  directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably  leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in  the path.) \tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error: \t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue \t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation) \t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)  \tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The mention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)  -- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file    system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your    font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an    xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and    the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.  -- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server    (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file    \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're    running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find    it, run bldfamily(1).)  -- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a    proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for    example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.

It can be  used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can  understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools  such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail  from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU.

How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?) I want to be able to do something like this: \txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave  \tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]  However: \tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of  the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick  (basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of  image formats as a pixmap.  \tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used  by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM  distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write  routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on  the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen  (anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.  \tYou probably have an extra space after the specification of the first  item, like this: \tbasic*text.translations:  #override \\ \tCtrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\n\\ \t \tCtrl<Key>e:    end-of-line() \t\t\t\t\t      ^ extra space The newline after that space is ending the translation definition. [Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?  \tOne solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show the time for timezones other than the local one.  \tAlternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this: \t#!/bin/sh \tTZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\" 2> /dev/null & \tTZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \"King_Of_Prussia_PA\" 2> /dev/null &  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?  \tThe xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system, which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list  of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in  the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z. If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list,  you can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh,  by sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request \"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\".  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server? After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no other clients are able to connect to it.  \tThe default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least) delete \"old\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which  contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add \"! -type s\" to the find exclusion in the cron job. [10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen?  The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun?   Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the  appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT doesn't do this but there are two different patches available.   The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related  problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .   The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and  Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.   [thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]  A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups 11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?  \tGenerally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly  from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]  [Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  52)  Why do I get \"Warning: Widget class version mismatch\"?  \tThis error, which typically goes on to say, \"widget 11004 vs.  intrinsics 11003\" indicates that the header files you included when building  your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking  against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure. \tHowever, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the  X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library,  and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you have seen.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?  \tWebster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster  and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access. \t[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu  (129.79.254.192) in \"pub/webster/NeXT-2.0\".] \tUnless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.   \tHowever, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file  xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and  non-availability of dictionary servers.  \t [courtesy steve@UMIACS.UMD.EDU (Steve Miller) and mayer@hplabs.hp.com (Niels  Mayer) 11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?  \tNo. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not  \"public domain\", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X  distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee. \tContributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by individual authors.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?  The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the  previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility  across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary,  details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the  network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the  file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.  [Stephen Gildea, 1/92]  The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)?  Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape  and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from  Software Center, Technology Licensing Office, Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, 28 Carleton Street, Room E32-300, Cambridge MA 02142-1324, phone: 617-258-8330.  You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to hold the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies.   PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network.  Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a guide to the distribution.  \t\t\t  North America anonymous FTP:  California\tgatekeeper.dec.com\t\tpub/X11/R5 \t\t16.1.0.2 California\tsoda.berkeley.edu\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t128.32.131.179 Indiana\t\tmordred.cs.purdue.edu\t\tpub/X11/R5 \t\t128.10.2.2 Maryland\tftp.brl.mil\t\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t128.63.16.158 \t\t(good for MILNET sites) Massachusetts\tcrl.dec.com\t\t\tpub/X11/R5 \t\t192.58.206.2 Massachusetts\texport.lcs.mit.edu\t\tpub/R5 \t\t18.24.0.12 \t\t(crl.dec.com is better) Michigan\tmerit.edu\t\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t35.1.1.42 Missouri\twuarchive.wustl.edu\t\tpackages/X11R5 \t\t128.252.135.4 Montana\t\tftp.cs.montana.edu\t\tpub/X.V11R5 \t\t192.31.215.202 New Mexico\tpprg.eece.unm.edu\t\tpub/dist/X11R5 \t\t129.24.24.10 New York\tazure.acsu.buffalo.edu\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t128.205.7.6 North Carolina\tcs.duke.edu\t\t\tdist/sources/X11R5 \t\t128.109.140.1 Ohio\t\tftp.cis.ohio-state.edu\t\tpub/X.V11R5 \t\t128.146.8.52 Ontario\t\tftp.cs.utoronto.ca\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t128.100.1.105 Washington DC\tx11r5-a.uu.net\t\t\tX/R5 \t\t192.48.96.12 Washington DC\tx11r5-b.uu.net\t\t\tX/R5 \t\t137.39.1.12  \t\t   Europe/Middle East/Australia anonymous FTP:  Australia\tmunnari.oz.au\t\t\tX.V11/R5 \t\t128.250.1.21 Denmark\t\tfreja.diku.dk\t\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t129.142.96.1 United Kingdom\tsrc.doc.ic.ac.uk\t\tgraphics/X.V11R5 \t\t146.169.3.7 \t\thpb.mcc.ac.uk\t\t\tpub/X11r5 \t\t130.88.200.7 Finland\t\tnic.funet.fi\t\t\tpub/X11/R5 \t\t128.214.6.100 France\t\tnuri.inria.fr\t\t\tX/X11R5 \t\t128.93.1.26 Germany\t\tftp.germany.eu.net\t\tpub/X11/X11R5 \t\t192.76.144.129 Israel\t\tcs.huji.ac.il\t\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t132.65.6.5 Italy\t\tghost.sm.dsi.unimi.it\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t149.132.2.1 Netherlands\tarchive.eu.net\t\t\twindows/X/R5 \t\t192.16.202.1 Norway\t\tugle.unit.no\t\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t129.241.1.97 Norway\t\tnac.no\t\t\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t129.240.2.40 Switzerland\tnic.switch.ch\t\t\tsoftware/X11R5 \t\t130.59.1.40  \t\t\t Japan anonymous FTP:  Kanagawa\tsh.wide.ad.jp\t\t\tX11R5 \t\t133.4.11.11 Kwansai\t\tftp.ics.osaka-u.ac.jp\t\tX11R5 \t\t133.1.12.30 Kyushu\t\twnoc-fuk.wide.ad.jp\t\tX11R5 \t\t133.4.14.3 TISN\t\tutsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp\t\tX11R5 \t\t133.11.11.11 Tokyo\t\tkerr.iwanami.co.jp\t\tX11R5 \t\t133.235.128.1 Tokyo\t\tscslwide.sony.co.jp\t\tpub/X11R5 \t\t133.138.199.1  \t\t\t\tUUCP:  uunet\t\tfor UUNET customers\t\t~/X/R5 decwrl\t\texisting neighbors only\t\t~/pub/X11/R5 osu-cis\t\t\t\t\t\t~/X.V11R5 \t\t(not online until ~ 9 Sept) utai\t\texisting neighbors only\t\t~/ftp/pub/X11R5 hp4nl\t\tNetherlands only\t\t~uucp/pub/windows/X/R5 \t\t   \t\t\t\t NFS: Missouri\twuarchive.wustl.edu\t\t/archive/packages/X11R5 \t\t128.252.135.4\t\t\tmount point: /archive \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t AFS: Pennsylvania\t/afs/grand.central.org/pub/X11R5  \t\t     NIFTP (hhcp, cpf, fcp, ...): United Kingdom\tuk.ac.ic.doc.src\t\t<X.V11R5> \t\t00000510200001 \t\tuser \"guest\"  \t\t\t      anon FTAM: United Kingdom\t000005102000 (Janet)\t\tX.V11R5 \t\t146.169.3.7 (Internet) \t\t204334504108 (IXI)  \t\t\t       ACSNet: Australia\tmunnari.oz (fetchfile)\t\tX.V11/R5 \t\tPlease fetch only one file \t\tat a time, after checking \t\tthat a copy is not available \t\tat a closer site.

Begging everyone's pardon, I was not slamming Motif, nor was I necessarily  plugging/flaming the two.  I was responding to the sweet blithe statement in:  <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (Rick Richardson)  rick> This is one area where Microsoft NT has a big advantage.  Since rick> they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where rick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards.  This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not, by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience), and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as mentioned before, the \"socialistic masses\" that were bent on destroying  _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards.  It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.  Mrs. Henne  \n",

There are several products you might investigate.  If you've got $20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't be too hard to find.  If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook (hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting, but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.  You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs $495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.  The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced, translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.  Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages a court would award.  However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit, almost certainly it is \"obvious to one skilled in the art\" and therefore unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory) cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.  Caution:  I am not a lawyer.

Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In particular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some XDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.  Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server bug?  Thanks,  Zack T.

One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system.  We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.  Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a \"dirty\" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.       -- Douglas S. Rand <drand@osf.org>\t\tOSF/Motif Dev.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers  \tAlthough we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not \telectricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If \tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't \tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician, \tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke; \tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.  \tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National \tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC). \tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail \twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections \tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong, \twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!  \tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the \tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others, \thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building \tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in \tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also, \tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements \tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that \twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family \tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial \testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different \trules.  \tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in \tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary \tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada. \tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line \tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number \tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've \tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or \t``CEC''.  \tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often \tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the \tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group. \tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released. \tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly \tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the \tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged \tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. \tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized \tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the \trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for \tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive -- \tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up \tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance \tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. \tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two \tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments, \tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book. \tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified \tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA \tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the \tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is \tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th \tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th \tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an \tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.  \tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical \tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In \tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't \toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I \thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the \tequivalent NEC publications.  \tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout \tthe province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?  \tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. \tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical \tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's \thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do \twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) \tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However, \tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial \twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can \tfind one willing to supervise.  \tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:  \tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better \tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home, \tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make \ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills \tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. \tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that \tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, \tand will impress the inspector.  \tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to \tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your \ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners. \tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely \tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.  \tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.  \tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip \twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector \twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it \ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of \t12ga wire through your hand that way.  \tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C \tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types \tbecome very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?  \tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few \tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're  \tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved \tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers \t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.  \tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or \t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or \tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill \t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and \t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull \tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even \tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.  \tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you \tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws \twork well). \t \tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or \tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper, \tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay \t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized \tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should \tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the \tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There \tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't \tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.  \tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends \tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.  \tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.  \tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling \tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire \tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more \taccurate.  \tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for \tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the \tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, \tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a \t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip \tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to \tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley \tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) \tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility \tthat you'll gouge the conductors.  \tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well \tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18). \tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire \tor the insulation.  \tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired \toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more \texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple \tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated \twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost \tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.  \tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are \tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) \tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is \tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known \tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)  \tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. \tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or \ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.  \tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent \twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for \twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap  \taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination \tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to \tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet \tthat has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?  \tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be \tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent \tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment \tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means \tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements \tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily \tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just \tthat it probably won't kill you.  \tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are \tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However, \tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will \tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to \tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in \tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component \tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose. \tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring \tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or \toccupancy permits issued. \t Subject: What is CSA approval?  \tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the \tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in \tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done \twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to \tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is \trequired by law.  \tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved \tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the \tclaim.  \tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC \t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to \tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance \tcompanies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?  \tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers  \t    Residential Wiring \t    by Jeff Markell, \t    Craftsman Books, \t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.  \t    Practical Electrical Wiring \t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National \t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70 \t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan \t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.  \t    Wiring Simplified \t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan \t    Park Publishing Co. \t \tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC \trevision.  Which is currently 1990.  \tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called \t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version \tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the \tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring, \tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get \tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer \tquestions on the net ;-).  \tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is \tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?  \tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and \tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more \tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not \tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections \tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors \tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose \ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.  \tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your \thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a \tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about \tthis.  \tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at \tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage \tclaims.  \tIn general, the process goes like this: \t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building \t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or \t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is \t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not \t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose \t\t  special conditions on you, require loading \t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point \t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need. \t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to \t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected \t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection. \t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority \t\t  rather than the usual inspectors. \t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before \t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a \t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection. \t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, \t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. \tDo I have to upgrade?  \tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, \tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some \tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the \tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you \tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all \tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240  \tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the \tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of \ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V \tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same \tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required \tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. \tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there \tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not \tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped \tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially \tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number \tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, \tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers. \tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and \t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will \tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.  \tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable \tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V \tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device \tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that \tlow.  \t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between \tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any \thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\" \tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.  \tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended \tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?  \tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the \tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility \tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.   \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes  \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where \tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic \taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)). \tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that \tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire \tnormally carries no current.  \tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or \tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire. \tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the \tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It \tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often \tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected \tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.  \tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in \ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode. \tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral \tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional \tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house \twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.  \tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually \tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are \tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one \tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations  \t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do \thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your \tinspector.  \tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\" \twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as \twell.  \tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each \tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires, \tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the \twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.  \tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. \tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected \ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one \twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some \trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only \tservice).  Subject: What is a circuit?  \tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. \tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected \tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations: \t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit. \t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit. \t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral, \t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.  \t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and \tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying \tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they \toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several \tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is \tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or \tair conditioners.  \t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar \tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there \tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral \tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing \tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead \tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. \tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles \tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but \tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC, \tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to \tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is \tpermissible.]  \t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, \twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.  \t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a \tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.  \tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground \twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC \trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends \tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail \tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.  \tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the \tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.  \tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) \tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places \trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\", \tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an \talternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".  \tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the \t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green \tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when \tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white \twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the \tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the \tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding \tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should \tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire \tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected \ttogether in the panel.  \t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground \tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]  \tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used \tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to \tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\" \ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light \tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?  \tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power \tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For \texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should \t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As \tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the \twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the \tequipment itself won't cause a fire.  \tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt \t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby \tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively \tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have \tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use \ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid \ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a \tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be \treplaced.  \tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They \tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched \tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow \tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip \theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the \tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave \tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to \ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high \toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite \tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown \twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which \tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in \tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the \tpurpose.  \tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead \tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even \tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which \tcan often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?  \tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher \trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually \tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts \tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse \tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a \tpenny\" trick.  \tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better \tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.  \tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When \ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting \tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, \tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical \tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down. \tBreakers don't do this.  \tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit \tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new \tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special \tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)  \tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse \tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse \tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the \tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently \tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you \tif you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?  \tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit, \tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run, \tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid \tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than \t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.  \tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for \tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or \tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate \theat easily:  \t\tGauge\t\tAmps \t\t14\t\t15 \t\t12\t\t20 \t\t10\t\t30 \t\t8\t\t40 \t\t6\t\t65 \t \tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent \ton the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?  \tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. \tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When \tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is \tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need \thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in \tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long \truns.  \tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances. \tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller \twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most \tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits \tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger \twire.  Subject: What does \"14-2\" mean?  \tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors \tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second \tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but \tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means \t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.  \t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes \tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In \tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.  \t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. \tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they \tused?  \tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used \tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\" \tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.  \tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them \ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.  \tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the \twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically \tsecure.  \tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check \tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the \tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.  \tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or \tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers, \tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes \tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it \tgoes in the wirenut properly.  \tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical \ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may \ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because \ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead \tof taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?  \tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures \tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the \tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the \tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other \tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of \tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any \tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking \tthe circuit.  \tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If, \tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral \tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI \twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot \tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the \tGFCI happy.  \tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric. \tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed \t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be \tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices \tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be \tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?  \tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase \toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, \tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or \tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water \tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, \tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', \ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and \tlaundry appliances.  \tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there \tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or \tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you \thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to \toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.  \tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may \twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI \tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI \toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in \tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your \tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children? \tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does \twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?  \tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a \tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run \tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers, \tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs \tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that \tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary \tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most \tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no \tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring \tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?  \tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the \tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with \ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI \tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE \tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one \tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch \tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), \tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a \tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive; \tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on \twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such \ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.  \tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use \tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use \tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.  \tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one \tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't \treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first \toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet \tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But \tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.  \tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little \t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark \tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which \toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the \ttest button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?  \tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, \tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without \ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against \tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of \tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an \tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the \tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly \ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not \tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if \tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of \tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very \ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace \tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).  \tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In \tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with \texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating \telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will \thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; \tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were \tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to \tground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization  \tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the \tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) \ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. \tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the \tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to \thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).  \tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.  \tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right \tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the \tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the \thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. \tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which \tprong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?  \tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance \tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex \treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more \tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider \tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet. \tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except \tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits \tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, \tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be \tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).  \tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab \tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to \tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. \tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When \t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be \tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral \tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect \tfrom downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?  \tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to \tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in \tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?  \tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. \tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM. \tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside \tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject \tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are \twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several \tdifferent categories of NM cable.  \tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a \tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is \tfairly resistant to damage.  \tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic \tsheath. \t \tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable \tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer \tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC) \tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected \tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of \tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.  \t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored \tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, \tbut this is technically illegal.]  \tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the \tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague \treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC \tand CEC):  \t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage \t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls \t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. \t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. \t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces \t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian \t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet \t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable \t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance. \t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. \t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating \t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by \t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation \t      material (a wad of fiberglass). \t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box \t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. \t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\". \t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to \t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation, \t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical] \t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge. \t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring \t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured \t      in the breach...] \t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or \t      similar finish. \t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. \t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists \t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more \t      than 1m (39\").  \tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small \tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to \tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through \tthe insulation.  \tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by \tsolid wall coverings.  \tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of \ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a \tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of \tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the \twire.  \tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.  \tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will \tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like \tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of \tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground \twiring section.]   \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be  \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  \tpurpose.  \tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through \tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed \tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this \tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses \tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building. \tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. \t  \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,  \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the  \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\". \tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.  \tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes \tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. \tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes. \tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything \tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.  \tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous, \tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)  \tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC  \tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90 \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t \tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc. \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90 \t \tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF \tService entrance\t\t\tRWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTWU \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90 \t[* NMWU not for service entrance]  Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?  \tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable \tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box \titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic \tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.  \tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable \tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still \tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also \trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.  \tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for \tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground \tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other \thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For \texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?  \tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.  \tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible \tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction \tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may \tget nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?  \tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few \tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage \trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half \ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire \tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle \tconstraints as well.  For example, older house \twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess \theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the \tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. \tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high \ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your \tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case \treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)  \tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some \tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and \tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy \tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box \tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling \tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available \tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and \tmounted between the joists.  \tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as \t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated \tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. \tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated \tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually \t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering \twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet* \tlong)  \tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\" \tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. \tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, \twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. \tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't \tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector \trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get \taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown \tin later.]  \tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and \tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are \tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat \tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should \tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses. \tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location \tfor the sensor can vary.  \tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved \tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?  \tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is \tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up \tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with \trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can \tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in \tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions \trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).  \tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately \tand have them come and check out the problem.  \tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with \tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A \tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness \tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?  \tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of \tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors \tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque, \tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.  \tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows \t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between \tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal \t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the \ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.  \tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually \tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you \twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to \tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is \tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have \ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a \t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if \tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to \treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an \tarticle on how to do this if you must.  \tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using \tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?  \tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there \tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply \twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times \tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also \tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor \twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the \tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.  \tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more \tthan 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?  \tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 \twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, \tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 \twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, \tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational \tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.  \tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router \tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far \tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall \thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when \tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. \tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that \tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker \twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far \tmore current than it can continuously.  \tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This \tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure, \tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?  \tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead \tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety \tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither \tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.  \tThere are several different approaches to solving this: \t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the \t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect \t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle \t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise. \t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and \t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can \t       run a conductor to it from the third prong. \t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel. \t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug \t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI \t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI \t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong \t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets, \t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it \t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault \t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected \t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't \t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath \t       on BX cable.  \tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three \tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop. \tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets? \tShould the test button work?  \tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though, \tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's \ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE \tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current \tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI. \tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require \ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press \tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again: \tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially \tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.  \tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground \twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The \tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the \tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never \ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand, \tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device \tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded \toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are \tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician \twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require \tit, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?  \tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all \tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies \tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the \tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for \tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or \tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have \tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp \tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles \twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights \tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared \twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two \tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a \tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand \tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.  \tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the \tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. \tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each \tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same \ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and \tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have \tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit \twrong.  \tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\" \trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used \tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be \trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.  \tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V \tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. \tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you \tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled \textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of \tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much \theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)  \tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, \tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop \twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to \tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. \tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' \tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. \tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to \thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy \t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.  \tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished \tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And \teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop \toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might \thave a different idea.  \tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop \twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring  \tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use \tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic \ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots \tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion \tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is \tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically \tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, \tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion \tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And \tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.  \tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to \tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about \tyour specific situation.  \tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power \tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring  \tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became \tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time, \taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, \tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. \tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new \twiring.  \tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum \twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. \tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper \tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential \tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.  \tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as \t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When \tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes \tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each \ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes \twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance \tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ \toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot, \tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even \tcause a fire.  \tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move \tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of \tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing \ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you \thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring \tfor the following things:  \t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to \t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will \t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes \t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat \t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.  \t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around \t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be \t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the \t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug \t       up each connection.  \t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the \t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.  \t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. \t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with \t       the proper screw connections immediately.  \t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, \t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should \t       be repaired. \t     \t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be \t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the \t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting \t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be \t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an \t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter \t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless \t       you can rent the tool.  \t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring \t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above. \t     \t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped \t       (not nicked) wire etc.      \tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring \tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider \tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places, \twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used, \tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having \tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. \tYou can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?  \tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire \tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. \tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an \tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor \tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any \tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many \tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.  \tHere's some hints on what to look for:  \tObvious non-code wiring can include:  \t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls \t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without \t\t  proper marking. \t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of \t\t  a GFCI) \t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) \t\t- Switched neutrals \t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines  \tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one \ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:  \t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps \t\t   not properly terminated wiring) \t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are \t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when \t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-) \t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations \t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps \t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them \t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or \t\t  ceiling \t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring \t \tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different \twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you \tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old  \tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.  \tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called \t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with \ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural \tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). \tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections \twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping \twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately, \tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs \tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture. \tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some \tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same \tcolour as the hot wires.  \tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.  \tComments on K&T:  \t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about \t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. \t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up \t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in \t\t  quite good condition. \t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install. \t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with \t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either, \t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. \t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between \t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to \t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on \t\t  any circuit. \t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls \t\t  that contain K&T. \t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be \t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector. \t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more \t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did. \t \tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't \tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should \twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and \tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly \treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on \tnew circuits using modern techniques. \t \tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type \tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks \tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was \tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor. \tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback \tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole \tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at \ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.  \tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if \tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as \tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. \tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several \thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink \ttubing.  \tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. \tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky. \tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard \tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be \treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff - \tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?  \tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their \tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or \tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety \tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that \tknow what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable \tsales people.  They'll give you much valuable information. --  Chris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541 Psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca Ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca \n",

Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.  Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\" turbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]  The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data. Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad \n",

At nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination.  Wayne Martin    \n",

I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range.

These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.  PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the  programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

Raw HC11 parts have factory set ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.  Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing the EPROM array to light.

Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert unbalanced 1/4\" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher quality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from  Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4\". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30. You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear. The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.  ----- John Bell NASA Langley Research Center bell@hops.larc.nasa.gov  \n",

In our case, other monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side of wall maybe? We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it.  Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type O'scopes). I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor.  BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO MOUNT CAN. Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other sources.  Jeff Babb babb@sciences.sdsu.edu   babb@ucssun1.sdsu.edu Programmer, SDSU - LARC \n",

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones (BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might call MCL; they have a nice catalog.  The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second!

The specs call for a few sequences to be met before standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but I thought that I had it worked out.

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu, Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some documentation.

So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.  As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).  Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check their common sense list.

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips or can't be read.  Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer assembly are tightened properly.

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a \"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn  N6GN @ K3MC       amateur IP:\tglenn@SantaRosa.ampr.org Internet:\tglenne@sr.hp.com    \n",

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!  Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView. I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage() is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that: (1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or (2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?  All help appreciated...thanks!  Derek  ----------------------------------------------------------- | Derek C.

Sure the amp runs very fairly : >  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  : An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound. : The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.  : Actually, I'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though : the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive  : heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component : regardless of quality.  In fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is : because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted : to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....  Sure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the   amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to   the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely. I don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that   the amp is doing nothing :) The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for   skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below   and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.  My opinions once again.  -- *********************************************************************** **    Alan Webber                                                    ** **                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          ** **                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          ** **                                                                   ** ** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  ** ** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          ** ** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             ** ** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    ** *********************************************************************** \n",

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers  \tAlthough we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not \telectricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If \tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't \tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician, \tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke; \tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.  \tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National \tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC). \tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail \twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections \tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong, \twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!  \tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the \tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others, \thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building \tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in \tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also, \tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements \tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that \twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family \tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial \testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different \trules.  \tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in \tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary \tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada. \tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line \tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number \tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've \tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or \t``CEC''.  \tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often \tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the \tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group. \tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released. \tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly \tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the \tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged \tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. \tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized \tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the \trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for \tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive -- \tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up \tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance \tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. \tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two \tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments, \tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book. \tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified \tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA \tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the \tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is \tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th \tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th \tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an \tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.  \tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical \tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In \tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't \toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I \thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the \tequivalent NEC publications.  \tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout \tthe province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?  \tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. \tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical \tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's \thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do \twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) \tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However, \tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial \twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can \tfind one willing to supervise.  \tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:  \tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better \tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home, \tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make \ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills \tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. \tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that \tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, \tand will impress the inspector.  \tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to \tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your \ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners. \tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely \tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.  \tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.  \tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip \twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector \twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it \ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of \t12ga wire through your hand that way.  \tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C \tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types \tbecome very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?  \tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few \tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're  \tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved \tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers \t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.  \tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or \t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or \tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill \t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and \t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull \tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even \tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.  \tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you \tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws \twork well). \t \tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or \tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper, \tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay \t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized \tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should \tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the \tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There \tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't \tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.  \tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends \tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.  \tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.  \tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling \tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire \tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more \taccurate.  \tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for \tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the \tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, \tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a \t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip \tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to \tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley \tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) \tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility \tthat you'll gouge the conductors.  \tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well \tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18). \tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire \tor the insulation.  \tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired \toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more \texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple \tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated \twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost \tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.  \tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are \tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) \tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is \tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known \tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)  \tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. \tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or \ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.  \tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent \twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for \twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap  \taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination \tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to \tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet \tthat has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?  \tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be \tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent \tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment \tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means \tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements \tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily \tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just \tthat it probably won't kill you.  \tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are \tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However, \tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will \tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to \tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in \tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component \tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose. \tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring \tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or \toccupancy permits issued. \t Subject: What is CSA approval?  \tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the \tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in \tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done \twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to \tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is \trequired by law.  \tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved \tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the \tclaim.  \tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC \t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to \tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance \tcompanies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?  \tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers  \t    Residential Wiring \t    by Jeff Markell, \t    Craftsman Books, \t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.  \t    Practical Electrical Wiring \t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National \t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70 \t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan \t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.  \t    Wiring Simplified \t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan \t    Park Publishing Co. \t \tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC \trevision.  Which is currently 1990.  \tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called \t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version \tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the \tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring, \tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get \tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer \tquestions on the net ;-).  \tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is \tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?  \tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and \tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more \tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not \tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections \tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors \tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose \ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.  \tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your \thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a \tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about \tthis.  \tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at \tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage \tclaims.  \tIn general, the process goes like this: \t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building \t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or \t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is \t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not \t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose \t\t  special conditions on you, require loading \t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point \t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need. \t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to \t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected \t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection. \t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority \t\t  rather than the usual inspectors. \t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before \t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a \t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection. \t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, \t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. \tDo I have to upgrade?  \tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, \tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some \tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the \tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you \tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all \tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240  \tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the \tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of \ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V \tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same \tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required \tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. \tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there \tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not \tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped \tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially \tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number \tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, \tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers. \tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and \t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will \tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.  \tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable \tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V \tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device \tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that \tlow.  \t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between \tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any \thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\" \tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.  \tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended \tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?  \tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the \tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility \tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.   \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes  \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where \tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic \taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)). \tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that \tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire \tnormally carries no current.  \tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or \tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire. \tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the \tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It \tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often \tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected \tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.  \tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in \ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode. \tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral \tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional \tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house \twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.  \tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually \tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are \tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one \tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations  \t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do \thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your \tinspector.  \tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\" \twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as \twell.  \tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each \tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires, \tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the \twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.  \tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. \tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected \ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one \twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some \trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only \tservice).  Subject: What is a circuit?  \tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. \tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected \tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations: \t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit. \t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit. \t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral, \t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.  \t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and \tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying \tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they \toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several \tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is \tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or \tair conditioners.  \t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar \tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there \tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral \tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing \tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead \tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. \tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles \tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but \tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC, \tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to \tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is \tpermissible.]  \t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, \twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.  \t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a \tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.  \tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground \twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC \trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends \tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail \tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.  \tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the \tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.  \tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) \tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places \trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\", \tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an \talternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".  \tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the \t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green \tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when \tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white \twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the \tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the \tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding \tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should \tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire \tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected \ttogether in the panel.  \t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground \tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]  \tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used \tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to \tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\" \ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light \tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?  \tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power \tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For \texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should \t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As \tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the \twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the \tequipment itself won't cause a fire.  \tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt \t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby \tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively \tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have \tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use \ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid \ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a \tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be \treplaced.  \tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They \tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched \tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow \tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip \theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the \tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave \tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to \ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high \toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite \tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown \twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which \tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in \tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the \tpurpose.  \tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead \tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even \tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which \tcan often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?  \tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher \trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually \tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts \tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse \tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a \tpenny\" trick.  \tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better \tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.  \tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When \ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting \tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, \tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical \tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down. \tBreakers don't do this.  \tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit \tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new \tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special \tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)  \tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse \tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse \tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the \tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently \tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you \tif you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?  \tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit, \tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run, \tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid \tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than \t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.  \tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for \tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or \tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate \theat easily:  \t\tGauge\t\tAmps \t\t14\t\t15 \t\t12\t\t20 \t\t10\t\t30 \t\t8\t\t40 \t\t6\t\t65 \t \tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent \ton the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?  \tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. \tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When \tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is \tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need \thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in \tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long \truns.  \tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances. \tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller \twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most \tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits \tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger \twire.  Subject: What does \"14-2\" mean?  \tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors \tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second \tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but \tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means \t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.  \t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes \tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In \tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.  \t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. \tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they \tused?  \tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used \tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\" \tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.  \tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them \ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.  \tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the \twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically \tsecure.  \tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check \tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the \tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.  \tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or \tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers, \tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes \tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it \tgoes in the wirenut properly.  \tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical \ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may \ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because \ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead \tof taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?  \tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures \tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the \tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the \tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other \tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of \tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any \tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking \tthe circuit.  \tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If, \tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral \tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI \twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot \tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the \tGFCI happy.  \tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric. \tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed \t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be \tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices \tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be \tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?  \tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase \toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, \tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or \tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water \tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, \tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', \ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and \tlaundry appliances.  \tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there \tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or \tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you \thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to \toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.  \tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may \twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI \tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI \toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in \tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your \tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children? \tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does \twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?  \tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a \tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run \tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers, \tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs \tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that \tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary \tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most \tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no \tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring \tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?  \tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the \tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with \ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI \tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE \tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one \tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch \tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), \tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a \tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive; \tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on \twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such \ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.  \tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use \tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use \tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.  \tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one \tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't \treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first \toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet \tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But \tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.  \tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little \t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark \tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which \toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the \ttest button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?  \tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, \tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without \ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against \tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of \tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an \tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the \tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly \ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not \tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if \tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of \tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very \ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace \tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).  \tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In \tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with \texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating \telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will \thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; \tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were \tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to \tground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization  \tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the \tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) \ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. \tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the \tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to \thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).  \tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.  \tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right \tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the \tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the \thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. \tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which \tprong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?  \tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance \tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex \treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more \tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider \tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet. \tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except \tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits \tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, \tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be \tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).  \tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab \tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to \tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. \tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When \t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be \tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral \tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect \tfrom downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?  \tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to \tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in \tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?  \tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. \tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM. \tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside \tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject \tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are \twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several \tdifferent categories of NM cable.  \tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a \tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is \tfairly resistant to damage.  \tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic \tsheath. \t \tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable \tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer \tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC) \tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected \tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of \tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.  \t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored \tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, \tbut this is technically illegal.]  \tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the \tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague \treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC \tand CEC):  \t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage \t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls \t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. \t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. \t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces \t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian \t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet \t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable \t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance. \t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. \t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating \t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by \t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation \t      material (a wad of fiberglass). \t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box \t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. \t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\". \t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to \t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation, \t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical] \t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge. \t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring \t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured \t      in the breach...] \t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or \t      similar finish. \t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. \t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists \t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more \t      than 1m (39\").  \tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small \tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to \tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through \tthe insulation.  \tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by \tsolid wall coverings.  \tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of \ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a \tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of \tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the \twire.  \tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.  \tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will \tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like \tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of \tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground \twiring section.]   \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be  \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  \tpurpose.  \tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through \tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed \tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this \tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses \tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building. \tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. \t  \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,  \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the  \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\". \tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.  \tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes \tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. \tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes. \tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything \tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.  \tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous, \tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)  \tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC  \tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90 \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t \tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc. \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90 \t \tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF \tService entrance\t\t\tRWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTWU \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90 \t[* NMWU not for service entrance]  Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?  \tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable \tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box \titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic \tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.  \tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable \tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still \tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also \trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.  \tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for \tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground \tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other \thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For \texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?  \tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.  \tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible \tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction \tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may \tget nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?  \tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few \tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage \trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half \ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire \tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle \tconstraints as well.  For example, older house \twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess \theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the \tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. \tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high \ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your \tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case \treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)  \tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some \tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and \tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy \tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box \tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling \tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available \tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and \tmounted between the joists.  \tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as \t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated \tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. \tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated \tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually \t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering \twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet* \tlong)  \tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\" \tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. \tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, \twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. \tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't \tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector \trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get \taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown \tin later.]  \tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and \tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are \tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat \tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should \tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses. \tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location \tfor the sensor can vary.  \tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved \tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?  \tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is \tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up \tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with \trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can \tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in \tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions \trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).  \tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately \tand have them come and check out the problem.  \tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with \tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A \tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness \tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?  \tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of \tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors \tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque, \tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.  \tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows \t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between \tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal \t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the \ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.  \tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually \tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you \twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to \tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is \tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have \ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a \t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if \tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to \treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an \tarticle on how to do this if you must.  \tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using \tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?  \tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there \tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply \twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times \tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also \tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor \twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the \tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.  \tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more \tthan 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?  \tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 \twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, \tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 \twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, \tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational \tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.  \tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router \tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far \tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall \thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when \tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. \tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that \tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker \twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far \tmore current than it can continuously.  \tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This \tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure, \tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?  \tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead \tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety \tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither \tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.  \tThere are several different approaches to solving this: \t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the \t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect \t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle \t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise. \t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and \t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can \t       run a conductor to it from the third prong. \t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel. \t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug \t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI \t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI \t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong \t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets, \t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it \t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault \t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected \t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't \t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath \t       on BX cable.  \tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three \tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop. \tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets? \tShould the test button work?  \tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though, \tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's \ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE \tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current \tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI. \tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require \ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press \tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again: \tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially \tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.  \tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground \twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The \tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the \tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never \ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand, \tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device \tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded \toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are \tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician \twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require \tit, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?  \tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all \tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies \tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the \tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for \tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or \tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have \tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp \tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles \twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights \tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared \twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two \tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a \tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand \tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.  \tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the \tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. \tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each \tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same \ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and \tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have \tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit \twrong.  \tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\" \trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used \tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be \trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.  \tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V \tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. \tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you \tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled \textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of \tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much \theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)  \tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, \tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop \twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to \tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. \tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' \tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. \tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to \thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy \t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.  \tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished \tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And \teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop \toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might \thave a different idea.  \tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop \twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring  \tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use \tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic \ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots \tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion \tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is \tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically \tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, \tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion \tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And \tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.  \tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to \tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about \tyour specific situation.  \tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power \tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring  \tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became \tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time, \taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, \tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. \tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new \twiring.  \tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum \twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. \tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper \tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential \tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.  \tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as \t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When \tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes \tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each \ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes \twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance \tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ \toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot, \tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even \tcause a fire.  \tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move \tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of \tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing \ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you \thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring \tfor the following things:  \t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to \t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will \t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes \t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat \t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.  \t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around \t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be \t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the \t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug \t       up each connection.  \t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the \t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.  \t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. \t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with \t       the proper screw connections immediately.  \t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, \t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should \t       be repaired. \t     \t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be \t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the \t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting \t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be \t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an \t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter \t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless \t       you can rent the tool.  \t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring \t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above. \t     \t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped \t       (not nicked) wire etc.      \tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring \tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider \tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places, \twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used, \tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having \tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. \tYou can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?  \tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire \tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. \tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an \tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor \tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any \tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many \tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.  \tHere's some hints on what to look for:  \tObvious non-code wiring can include:  \t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls \t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without \t\t  proper marking. \t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of \t\t  a GFCI) \t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) \t\t- Switched neutrals \t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines  \tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one \ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:  \t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps \t\t   not properly terminated wiring) \t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are \t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when \t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-) \t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations \t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps \t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them \t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or \t\t  ceiling \t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring \t \tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different \twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you \tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old  \tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.  \tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called \t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with \ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural \tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). \tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections \twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping \twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately, \tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs \tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture. \tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some \tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same \tcolour as the hot wires.  \tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.  \tComments on K&T:  \t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about \t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. \t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up \t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in \t\t  quite good condition. \t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install. \t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with \t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either, \t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. \t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between \t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to \t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on \t\t  any circuit. \t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls \t\t  that contain K&T. \t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be \t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector. \t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more \t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did. \t \tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't \tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should \twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and \tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly \treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on \tnew circuits using modern techniques. \t \tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type \tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks \tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was \tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor. \tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback \tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole \tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at \ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.  \tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if \tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as \tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. \tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several \thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink \ttubing.  \tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. \tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky. \tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard \tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be \treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff - \tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?  \tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their \tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or \tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety \tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that \tknow what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable \tsales people.  They'll give you much valuable information. --  Chris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541 Psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca Ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca \n",

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]  The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data. Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad \n",

      "\tFrom: ngai@nova.bellcore.com (John Ngai) Subject: How to disable reverse video on xterm/man Nntp-Posting-Host: nova.bellcore.com Organization: Bellcore Lines: 22  Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway. I am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently, I switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with \".I\" directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm. The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at. Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining....  So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under \".I\" directives  for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (\".B\"  directives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit the man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font, but not an italic font??  Any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks -- John  P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work, I tried...     \n",

Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch.  The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory.  On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation.   The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY  s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at  `hostname`:1.0  Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line. My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB  Bitmap Stuff Sucked. Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable. Xmail was very usable.  At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged \"WINDOWS should not be called a SCHEDULER\", besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while.  Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales person said they performed about the same, given the over head of WINDOWS I question this?  many thanks for help to all who responded  gerard \n",

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not, by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience), and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as mentioned before, the \"socialistic masses\" that were bent on destroying  _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are  no de facto standards.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers  \tAlthough we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not \telectricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If \tyou're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't \tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician, \tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke; \tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.  \tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National \tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC). \tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail \twith the electrical code, but we don't quote sections \tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong, \twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!  \tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the \tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others, \thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building \tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in \tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also, \tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements \tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that \twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family \tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial \testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different \trules.  \tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in \tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary \tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada. \tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line \tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number \tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've \tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or \t``CEC''.  \tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often \tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the \tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group. \tIt's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released. \tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly \tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the \tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged \tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. \tAnd there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized \tcommentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the \trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for \tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive -- \tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?  \tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up \tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance \tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. \tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two \tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments, \tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book. \tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified \tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA \tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the \tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is \tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th \tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th \tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an \tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.  \tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical \tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In \tOntario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't \toverly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I \thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the \tequivalent NEC publications.  \tDon't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout \tthe province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?  \tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. \tIn some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical \tinspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's \thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do \twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) \tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However, \tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial \twiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can \tfind one willing to supervise.  \tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:  \tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better \tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home, \tand it's you or your family that might get killed if you make \ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills \tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. \tIn this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that \tare in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, \tand will impress the inspector.  \tThe inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to \tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your \ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners. \tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely \tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.  \tDon't try to hide anything from the inspector.  \tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip \twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector \twon't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it \ttakes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of \t12ga wire through your hand that way.  \tDon't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C \tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types \tbecome very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?  \tFirst, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few \tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're  \tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved \tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers \t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.  \tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or \t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or \tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill \t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and \t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull \tyou through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even \tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.  \tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you \tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws \twork well). \t \tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or \tordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper, \tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay \t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized \tstripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should \tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the \tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There \tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't \tnecessary, and pros usually don't use them.  \tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends \tin constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.  \tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.  \tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling \tinside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire \tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more \taccurate.  \tIf you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for \tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the \tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, \tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a \t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip \tthe sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to \tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley \tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) \tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility \tthat you'll gouge the conductors.  \tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well \tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18). \tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire \tor the insulation.  \tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired \toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more \texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple \tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated \twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost \tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.  \tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are \tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) \tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is \tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known \tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)  \tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. \tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or \ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.  \tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent \twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for \twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap  \taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination \tscrews - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to \tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet \tthat has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?  \tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be \tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent \tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment \tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means \tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements \tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily \tmean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just \tthat it probably won't kill you.  \tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are \tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However, \tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will \tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to \tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in \tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component \tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose. \tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring \tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or \toccupancy permits issued. \t Subject: What is CSA approval?  \tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the \tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in \tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done \twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to \tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is \trequired by law.  \tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved \tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the \tclaim.  \tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC \t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to \tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance \tcompanies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?  \tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers  \t    Residential Wiring \t    by Jeff Markell, \t    Craftsman Books, \t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.  \t    Practical Electrical Wiring \t    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National \t    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70 \t    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan \t    McGraw-Hill Book Co.  \t    Wiring Simplified \t    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan \t    Park Publishing Co. \t \tTry to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC \trevision.  Which is currently 1990.  \tCanada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called \t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version \tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the \tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring, \tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get \tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer \tquestions on the net ;-).  \tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is \tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?  \tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and \tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more \tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not \tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections \tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors \tor subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose \ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.  \tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your \thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a \tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about \tthis.  \tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at \tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage \tclaims.  \tIn general, the process goes like this: \t\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building \t\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or \t\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is \t\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not \t\t  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose \t\t  special conditions on you, require loading \t\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point \t\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need. \t\t- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to \t\t  have the panel and service connections inspected \t\t  before your power utility will provide a connection. \t\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority \t\t  rather than the usual inspectors. \t\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before \t\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a \t\t  \"rough-in\" inspection. \t\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, \t\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. \tDo I have to upgrade?  \tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, \tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some \tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the \tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you \tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all \tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240  \tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the \tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of \ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V \tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same \tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required \tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. \tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there \tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not \tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped \tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially \tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number \tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, \tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers. \tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and \t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will \tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.  \tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable \tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V \tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device \tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that \tlow.  \t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between \tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any \thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\" \tcircuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.  \tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended \tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?  \tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the \tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility \tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.   \tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  \tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes  \tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where \tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic \taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)). \tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that \tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire \tnormally carries no current.  \tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or \tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire. \tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the \tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It \tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often \tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected \tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.  \tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in \ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode. \tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral \tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional \tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house \twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.  \tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually \tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are \tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one \tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations  \t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do \thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your \tinspector.  \tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\" \twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as \twell.  \tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each \tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires, \tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the \twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.  \tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. \tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected \ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one \twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some \trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only \tservice).  Subject: What is a circuit?  \tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. \tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected \tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations: \t\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit. \t\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit. \t\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral, \t\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.  \t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and \tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying \tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they \toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several \tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is \tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or \tair conditioners.  \t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar \tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there \tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral \tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing \tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead \tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. \tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles \tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but \tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC, \tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to \tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is \tpermissible.]  \t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, \twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.  \t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a \tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.  \tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground \twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC \trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends \tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail \tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.  \tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the \tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.  \tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) \tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places \trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\", \tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an \talternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".  \tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the \t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green \tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when \tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white \twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the \tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the \tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding \tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should \tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire \tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected \ttogether in the panel.  \t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground \tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]  \tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used \tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to \tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\" \ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light \tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?  \tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power \tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For \texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should \t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As \tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the \twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the \tequipment itself won't cause a fire.  \tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt \t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby \tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively \tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have \tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use \ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid \ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a \tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be \treplaced.  \tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They \tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched \tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow \tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip \theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the \tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave \tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to \ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high \toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite \tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown \twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which \tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in \tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the \tpurpose.  \tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead \tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even \tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which \tcan often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?  \tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher \trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually \tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts \tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse \tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a \tpenny\" trick.  \tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better \tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.  \tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When \ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting \tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, \tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical \tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down. \tBreakers don't do this.  \tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit \tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new \tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special \tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)  \tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse \tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse \tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the \tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently \tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you \tif you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?  \tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit, \tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run, \tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid \tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than \t14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.  \tHere's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for \tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or \tganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate \theat easily:  \t\tGauge\t\tAmps \t\t14\t\t15 \t\t12\t\t20 \t\t10\t\t30 \t\t8\t\t40 \t\t6\t\t65 \t \tWe don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent \ton the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?  \tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. \tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When \tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is \tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need \thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in \tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long \truns.  \tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances. \tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller \twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most \tlamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits \tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger \twire.  Subject: What does \"14-2\" mean?  \tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors \tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second \tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but \tremember there's usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means \t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.  \t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes \tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In \tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.  \t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. \tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they \tused?  \tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used \tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\" \tare trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.  \tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them \ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.  \tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the \twire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically \tsecure.  \tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check \tthat the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the \tquantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.  \tDon't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or \tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers, \tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes \tit's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it \tgoes in the wirenut properly.  \tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical \ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may \ttear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because \ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead \tof taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?  \tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures \tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the \tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the \tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other \tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of \tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any \tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking \tthe circuit.  \tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If, \tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral \tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI \twouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot \tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the \tGFCI happy.  \tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric. \tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed \t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be \tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices \tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be \tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?  \tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase \toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, \tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or \tjust about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water \tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, \tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', \ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and \tlaundry appliances.  \tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there \tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or \tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you \thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to \toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.  \tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may \twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI \tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI \toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in \tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your \tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children? \tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does \twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?  \tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a \tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run \tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers, \tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs \tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that \tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary \tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most \tGFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no \tapparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring \tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?  \tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the \tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with \ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI \tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE \tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one \tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch \tcircuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), \tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a \tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive; \tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on \twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such \ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.  \tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use \tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use \tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.  \tIncidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one \tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't \treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first \toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet \tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But \tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.  \tWhen you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little \t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark \tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which \toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the \ttest button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?  \tApart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, \tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without \ta good ground connection), they're intended to guard against \tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of \tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an \tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the \tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly \ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not \tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if \tyou touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of \tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very \ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace \tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).  \tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In \tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with \texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating \telectrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will \thappen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; \tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were \tgrounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to \tground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization  \tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the \tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) \ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. \tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the \tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to \thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).  \tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.  \tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right \tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the \tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the \thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. \tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which \tprong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?  \tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance \tcircuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex \treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more \tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider \tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet. \tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except \tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits \tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, \tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be \tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).  \tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab \tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to \tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. \tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When \t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be \tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral \tconnection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect \tfrom downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?  \tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to \tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in \tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?  \tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. \tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM. \tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside \tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject \tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are \twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several \tdifferent categories of NM cable.  \tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a \tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is \tfairly resistant to damage.  \tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic \tsheath. \t \tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable \tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer \tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC) \tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected \tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of \tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.  \t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored \tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, \tbut this is technically illegal.]  \tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the \tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague \treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC \tand CEC):  \t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage \t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls \t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. \t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. \t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces \t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian \t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet \t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable \t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance. \t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. \t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating \t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by \t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation \t      material (a wad of fiberglass). \t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box \t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. \t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\". \t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to \t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation, \t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical] \t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge. \t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring \t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured \t      in the breach...] \t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or \t      similar finish. \t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. \t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists \t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more \t      than 1m (39\").  \tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small \tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to \tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through \tthe insulation.  \tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by \tsolid wall coverings.  \tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of \ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a \tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of \tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the \twire.  \tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.  \tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will \tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like \tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of \tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground \twiring section.]   \tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be  \texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  \tpurpose.  \tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through \tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed \tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this \tis that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses \tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building. \tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. \t  \tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,  \texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the  \ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\". \tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.  \tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes \tmost often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. \tThere are very different requirements for mobile homes. \tCheck your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything \tthat's the slightest out of the ordinary.  \tWire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous, \tuncommon wire types or applications omitted)  \tCondition\t\t\tType\tCEC\tNEC  \tExposed/Concealed dry\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNM \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tAC90\tAC \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed damp\t\tplastic\tNMD90\tNMC \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90  \tExposed/Concealed wet\t\tplastic\tNMWU90 \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tACWU90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t \tExposed to weather\t\tplastic\tNMWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTW etc. \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tTECK90 \t \tDirect earth burial/\t\tplastic\tNMWU*\tUF \tService entrance\t\t\tRWU \t\t\t\t\t\tTWU \t\t\t\t\tarmor\tRA90 \t\t\t\t\t\tTECK90 \t\t\t\t\t\tACWU90 \t[* NMWU not for service entrance]  Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?  \tThe NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable \tonly.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box \titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic \tboxes don't use metal cable clamps.  \tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable \tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still \tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also \trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.  \tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for \tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground \tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other \thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For \texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?  \tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.  \tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible \tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction \tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may \tget nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?  \tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few \tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage \trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half \ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire \tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle \tconstraints as well.  For example, older house \twiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess \theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the \tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. \tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high \ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your \tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case \treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)  \tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some \tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and \tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy \tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box \tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling \tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available \tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and \tmounted between the joists.  \tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as \t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated \tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. \tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated \tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually \t8'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering \twith plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet* \tlong)  \tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\" \tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. \tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, \twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. \tPresumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't \tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector \trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get \taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown \tin later.]  \tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and \tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are \tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat \tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should \tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses. \tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location \tfor the sensor can vary.  \tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved \tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?  \tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is \tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up \tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with \trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can \tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in \tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions \trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).  \tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately \tand have them come and check out the problem.  \tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with \tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A \tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness \tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?  \tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of \tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors \tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque, \tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.  \tYou're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows \t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between \tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal \t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the \ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.  \tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually \tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you \twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to \tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is \tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have \ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a \t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if \tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to \treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an \tarticle on how to do this if you must.  \tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using \tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?  \tTheoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there \tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply \twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times \tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also \tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor \twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the \tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.  \tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more \tthan 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?  \tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 \twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, \tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 \twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, \tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational \tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.  \tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router \tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far \tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall \thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when \tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. \tWhat they don't mention is that if you kept it in that \tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker \twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far \tmore current than it can continuously.  \tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This \tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure, \tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?  \tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead \tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety \tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither \tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.  \tThere are several different approaches to solving this: \t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the \t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect \t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle \t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise. \t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and \t       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can \t       run a conductor to it from the third prong. \t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel. \t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug \t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI \t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI \t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong \t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets, \t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it \t       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault \t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected \t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't \t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath \t       on BX cable.  \tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three \tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop. \tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets? \tShould the test button work?  \tWe're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though, \tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's \ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE \tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current \tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI. \tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require \ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press \tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again: \tif the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially \tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.  \tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground \twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The \tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the \tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never \ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand, \tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device \tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded \toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are \tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician \twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require \tit, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?  \tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all \tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies \tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the \tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for \tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or \tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have \tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp \tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles \twhich means you'd have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights \tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared \twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two \tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a \tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand \tRPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.  \tDo install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the \tbeginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. \tIt's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each \tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same \ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and \tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have \tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit \twrong.  \tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\" \trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used \tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be \trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.  \tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V \tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. \tDon't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you \tcan help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled \textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of \tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much \theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)  \tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, \tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop \twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to \tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. \tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' \tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. \tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to \thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy \t``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.  \tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished \tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And \teven if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop \toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might \thave a different idea.  \tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop \twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring  \tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use \tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic \ttubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots \tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion \tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is \tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically \tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, \tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion \tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And \tof course, don't forget the GFCIs.  \tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to \tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about \tyour specific situation.  \tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power \tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring  \tDuring the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became \tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time, \taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, \tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. \tWe recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new \twiring.  \tBut don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum \twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. \tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper \tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential \tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.  \tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as \t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When \tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes \tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each \ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes \twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance \tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ \toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot, \tmelt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even \tcause a fire.  \tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move \tinto a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of \tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing \ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you \thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring \tfor the following things:  \t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to \t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will \t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes \t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat \t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.  \t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around \t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be \t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the \t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug \t       up each connection.  \t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the \t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.  \t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. \t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with \t       the proper screw connections immediately.  \t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, \t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should \t       be repaired. \t     \t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be \t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the \t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting \t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be \t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an \t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter \t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless \t       you can rent the tool.  \t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring \t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above. \t     \t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped \t       (not nicked) wire etc.      \tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring \tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider \tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places, \twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used, \tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having \tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. \tYou can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?  \tCongratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire \tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. \tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an \tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor \tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any \tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many \tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.  \tHere's some hints on what to look for:  \tObvious non-code wiring can include:  \t\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls \t\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without \t\t  proper marking. \t\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of \t\t  a GFCI) \t\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) \t\t- Switched neutrals \t\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines  \tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one \ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:  \t\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps \t\t   not properly terminated wiring) \t\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are \t\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when \t\t  it's *really* convenient ;-) \t\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations \t\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps \t\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them \t\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or \t\t  ceiling \t\t- Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring \t \tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different \twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you \tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old  \tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.  \tThe oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called \t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with \ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural \tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). \tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections \twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping \twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately, \tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs \tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture. \tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some \tcases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same \tcolour as the hot wires.  \tYou'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.  \tComments on K&T:  \t\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about \t\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. \t\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up \t\t  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in \t\t  quite good condition. \t\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install. \t\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with \t\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either, \t\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. \t\t- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between \t\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to \t\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on \t\t  any circuit. \t\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls \t\t  that contain K&T. \t\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be \t\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector. \t\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more \t\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did. \t \tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't \tnecessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should \twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and \tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly \treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on \tnew circuits using modern techniques. \t \tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type \tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks \tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was \tused in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor. \tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback \tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole \tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at \ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.  \tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if \tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as \tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. \tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several \thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink \ttubing.  \tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. \tIt's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky. \tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard \tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be \treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff - \tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?  \tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]  The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data. Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.  \t\t\t\t\t---Joel Kolstad \n",

I am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently, I switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with \".I\" directives that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm. The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at. Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords displayed with underlining....  So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under \".I\" directives  for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (\".B\"  directives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit the man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font and a bold font, but not an italic font??  Any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks -- John  P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work, I tried...     \n",

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to  be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for  granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running  3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even  a real issue. My ideal operating system:  \tBinary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize \tbinaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have \tbin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...  \tMulti-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac  \tand Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which  \thas gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in  \t80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips. \tNote NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.  \tBuilt-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton  \tor DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform  \tor display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly. \tso I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on   \tmy PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.  \tConfigurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS \tor NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.  \tObject oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have \tto re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch \tor my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda. Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.  They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory, and some stuff about comms.     The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and  X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.  The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips or can't be read.  Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer assembly are tightened properly.

So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.  As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).  Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check their common sense list.

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a \"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn  N6GN @ K3MC       amateur IP:\tglenn@SantaRosa.ampr.org Internet:\tglenne@sr.hp.com    \n",

Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in  quantity.  I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole  calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it  for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This  $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation,  import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor  chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.  If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or  distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.  -Joe Betts betts@netcom.com   P.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that  have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone else  had better luck with this strategy? \n",

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field.  The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done.  When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the default either.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT (not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a \"dag\" as well as the outer coating.

Has anyone out there had some experience in doing this?  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but I thought that I had it worked out.  However, with a 32kHz crystal the lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting to create.  I have done the following things:  1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is    low during this time.   2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or    WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks very much,  Martin. \n",

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu, Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server- resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code mentioned above...  Thanks for the help so far.

It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller. I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their 8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

The ability to program was >an entry requirement.  At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming)  start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects: Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000  assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and  Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea). The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company  for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special  Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).   The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering  (C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing  Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where  students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an  outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change  suddenly).   In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and  exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a  30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework  assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?  BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-).

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable 'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.
